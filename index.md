<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i>  [Max Weber's View of Objectivity
in Social Science](/md/weber1.html): This essay seeks to shed light on
Weber's view of the applicability of objectivity by answering a question
that dogs Weberian scholarship: Was Weber an advocate of value-free
social science?

<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i>  [Interpretation and Indeterminacy
in Discourse Analysis](/da/da_indet.html): This essay argues a hard
line: the exact meaning of a speaker's utterance in a contextualized
exchange is often indeterminate. Interactional linguistics, however,
reduces the indeterminacy and yields a more principled interpretation
than other approaches to discourse analysis.

<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i>  [A Wittgensteinian Approach to
Discourse Analysis](/da/lw_da.html): This essay takes Wittgenstein's
influence on discourse analysis a step further by using his writings as
the theoretical foundation for an approach to analyzing discourse that
is distinct from speech act theory, which stems from the analytic
tradition in philosophy. The essay suggests that a Wittgenstein-inspired
approach is closer in spirit and content to that of an unlikely
candidate whose views, in contrast to the analytic school, harbor a
distinctly Continental flavor and influence critical theory: Mikhail
Bakhtin.

<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> [Saussure's Sign](/md/the_sign.html): The sign, the signifier, and the signified are concepts of the school of thought known as structuralism, founded by Ferdinand de Saussure, a Swiss linguist, during lectures he gave between 1907 and 1911 at the University of Geneva. His views revolutionized the study of language, inaugurated modern linguistics, and influenced critical theory. The central tenet of structuralism is that the phenomena of human life are unintelligible except through their network of relationships, making the sign and the system (or structure) in which the sign is embedded primary concepts. As such, a sign--for instance, a word--gets its meaning only in relation to or in contrast with other signs in a system of signs. 

<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> [The Myth of Psychoanalysis: Wittgenstein Contra Freud](/md/tech.html): In this essay, my central thesis is that if, as Wittgenstein says, Freudian psychoanalysis is based in myth, its application to actual psychological problems does not, indeed cannot, resolve them. Instead, all it can do is clarify them or present them in a different light. Implicit in my argument is that this is how Wittgenstein thought of the results of psychoanalysis, much like he thought of the application of his philosophical technique to philosophical problems, especially those of metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics. As such, Wittgenstein is also subverting a larger myth: that the insights gained in psychoanalysis lead to the scientific resolution of psychological problems. [Read on ...](/md/tech.html)
