![Document Icon](/images/pdfblue.gif) [EMC Isilon Scale-Out NAS for
In-Place Hadoop Data
Analytics](http://www.emc.com/collateral/cc/h12532-isilon-in-place-hadoop-wp1.pdf). Storing data in EMC Isilon scale-out network-attached storage optimizes
data management for Hadoop analytics. Separating data from HDFS clients
and storing it in an Isilon cluster provides scalability, efficiency,
and workflow flexibility. Published by EMC. 

![Document Icon](/images/pdfblue.gif) [OneFS Multiprotocol Security
Untangled](http://www.emc.com/collateral/white-paper/h13115-wp-emc-isilon-onefs-multiprotocol-security-untangled.pdf).
This white paper describes the role that
identity management, authentication, and access control play in the EMC Isilon OneFS security system. Published by
EMC. 

![Document Icon](/images/pdfblue.gif) [Data Lakes for Data Science: Integrating Analytics Tools with Shared Infrastructure for Big Data](http://www.emc.com/collateral/cc/h14214-wp-emc-isilon-data-lakes-for-data-science.pdf). This paper examines the relationship between three primary domains of an enterprise big data program: data science, analytics frameworks, and IT infrastructure. A decision about tools or infrastructure in one domain can affect, and potentially limit, what can be done in the other domains. Published by EMC.

Hadoop Big Data
Analytics](http://www.emc.com/collateral/cc/h13564-wp-emc-isilon-analytics-multitenancy.pdf).
The EMC Isilon scale-out storage
platform provides multitenancy through access zones that segregate
tenants and their data sets. An access zone presents a portion of an
Isilon cluster as a secure virtual storage region with a unique HDFS
root directory for the zone’s tenant. With NFS, SMB, and HDFS access to
each zone, an Isilon cluster delivers a scalable multitenant storage
solution for analytics tools. Published by EMC
Isilon.

![Document Icon](/images/pdfblue.gif) [Compliance and Security for Hadoop Scale-Out Data Lakes](http://www.emc.com/collateral/white-paper/h13354-wp-security-compliance-scale-out-hadoop-data-lakes.pdf). As credit card companies, medical researchers, and financial institutions analyze data with Hadoop to detect fraud, improve health care, and create innovative products, the stored data poses a compliance problem: The Hadoop File System lacks the enterprise security features that compliance regulations require. As a result, big data analysts are imperiling the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of their Hadoop data. This white paper explains how the EMC Isilon OneFS operating system securely stores data for Hadoop analytics to help meet such compliance regulations as PCI DSS, FISMA, and HIPAA. Published by EMC.

Access with a Unified Security
Model](http://www.emc.com/collateral/software/cc/h10920-wp-onefs-multiprotocol.pdf). This white paper  explains how
the unified security model of OneFS resolves mismatches between the
permissions of Windows and Unix systems while preserving the security of
files and satisfying the expectations of users. Published by EMC Isilon.

### Linguistics

<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i>  [Topical Structure Analysis of
Accomplished English
Prose](/da/topical-structure-analysis-thesis-abstract.html): This study
analyzes the topical structure of accomplished essays and compares the
results with the topical structure tacitly preferred by assessors in
their judgments of student essays. The paper examines whether the same
patterns of topical structure that are rewarded by assessors in student
writing recur in professionals writing within a similar genre.

<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i>  [Creating Coherence with the
Passive Voice](/linguistics/active-voice-or-passive-voice.html): Joseph M.
Williams, the author of two influential books on academic and
professional writing, advocates the use of the passive voice to manage
the flow of information across sentences. For Williams, passive voice
not only develops an idea by adding details to it but also tightly fuses
sentences into a coherent whole. More: The passive voice can place new
information in a syntactic slot that emphasizes it--the end of the
sentence.

<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i>  [Identifying and Resolving
Ambiguity](/linguistics/types-of-ambiguity.html): This page analyzes some
headlines that exhibit at least one of three kinds of linguistic
ambiguity--lexical, syntactic, and semantic. In some of the examples,
the unintended meaning is so strong that, on first reading, it
overshadows the intended one.

<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i>  [Interpretation and Indeterminacy
in Discourse Analysis](/da/da_indet.html): This essay argues a hard
line: the exact meaning of a speaker's utterance in a contextualized
exchange is often indeterminate. Interactional linguistics, however,
reduces the indeterminacy and yields a more principled interpretation
than other approaches to discourse analysis.

<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i>  [A Wittgensteinian Approach to
Discourse Analysis](/da/lw_da.html): This essay takes Wittgenstein's
influence on discourse analysis a step further by using his writings as
the theoretical foundation for an approach to analyzing discourse that
is distinct from speech act theory, which stems from the analytic
tradition in philosophy. The essay suggests that a Wittgenstein-inspired
approach is closer in spirit and content to that of an unlikely
candidate whose views, in contrast to the analytic school, harbor a
distinctly Continental flavor and influence critical theory: Mikhail
Bakhtin.


### Critical Theory

<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i>  [Max Weber's View of Objectivity
in Social Science](/md/weber1.html): This essay seeks to shed light on
Weber's view of the applicability of objectivity by answering a question
that dogs Weberian scholarship: Was Weber an advocate of value-free
social science?

<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i>  [Saussure's
Sign](/md/the_sign.html): The sign, the signifier, and the signified are
concepts of the school of thought known as structuralism, founded by
Ferdinand de Saussure, a Swiss linguist, during lectures he gave between
1907 and 1911 at the University of Geneva. His views revolutionized the
study of language, inaugurated modern linguistics, and influenced
critical theory. The central tenet of structuralism is that the
phenomena of human life are unintelligible except through their network
of relationships, making the sign and the system (or structure) in which
the sign is embedded primary concepts. As such, a sign--for instance, a
word--gets its meaning only in relation to or in contrast with other
signs in a system of signs.

<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i>  **[The Myth of Psychoanalysis: Wittgenstein Contra Freud](/md/tech.html)** In this essay, my central thesis is that if, as Wittgenstein says, Freudian
psychoanalysis is based in myth, its application to actual psychological
problems does not, indeed cannot, resolve them. Instead, all it can do
is clarify them or present them in a different light. Implicit in my
argument is that this is how Wittgenstein thought of the results of
psychoanalysis, much like he thought of the application of his
philosophical technique to philosophical problems, especially those of
metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics. As such, Wittgenstein is also
subverting a larger myth: that the insights gained in psychoanalysis
lead to the scientific resolution of psychological problems. [Read on ...](/md/tech.html)
