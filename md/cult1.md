1 An Example of Postmodern Politics
===================================

Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno, commenting on Hitler's
propagandistic use of the radio, note "the gigantic fact that the speech
that penetrates everywhere replaces its content,"1 a formula that has
been taken one step further by television: On TV, the image
dominates,<img src="../images/bkhorkhe.gif" align="right"/> overpowering not only the fact of speech but also its content.

In his book [Breaking the News: How the Media Undermine American
Democracy], James Fallows shows how TV images smother speech with an anecdote about
a CBS reporter doing a story on President Ronald Reagan in 1984. The
reporter had documented the contradiction between what
Reagan said and what he did by showing him speaking at the Special
Olympics and at a nursing home while reporting that Reagan had cut
funding to children with disabilities and opposed funding for public
health. After Stahl's piece was broadcast, she got a call from a White
House official, who praised her. Surprised by the compliments, She asked
the White House official why he wasn't upset, pointing out that her
piece had nailed the president. The official replied:

"You television people still don't get it. No one heard what you said.
Don't you people realize that the picture is all that counts. A powerful
picture drowns out the words."2





2 Substantive Views Obscured
============================

Perhaps this statement marks the dawn of postmodern politics in America.
With it, postmodernism has
moved <img src="../images/bbmonop.gif" align="right"/> beyond the realm of the media and into the sphere of politics, at least
as viewed through the lens of the press. According to Fallows,
reporters' "experience of recent politics, as they understand it, is of
being endlessly manipulated and 'spun' by politicians who care about
appearance rather than substance, and who win elections by concealing
their substantive views."3

The effect of this view of politicians and politics, whether accurate or
not, shifts viewers' attitudes from seeking substantive information,
arguments, and analyses about political issues to becoming "sneering and
supercilious" about politics.4
