1 *Read All About It*
=====================

<img src="../images/bbmonop.gif" align="right" /> *Read
All About It: The Corporate Takeover of America's Newspapers* is an
institutional acknowledgement of what many wary readers have known for
years: Corporate control is ruining our daily newspapers.

Oh, excuse me: I didn't mean to say "our" newspapers. It's just that
I've always thought of daily newspapers as the guardians of our --
meaning the public's -- right to know. The guardians of truth, justice,
the public welfare and all that.

But who am I fooling. America's daily newspapers don't belong to us.
Nor, for that matter, do they even seek to serve us any longer. They
have more important concerns now: appeasing advertisers and enriching
stockholders. *Read All About It*, by James D. Squires, the editor of
the Chicago Tribune from 1981 to 1989, explains why.





2 "Good Journalism Costs More"
==============================

The story goes like this: Before the 1970s, the traditional values of
public service journalism prevailed. Most of the publishing barons
remained devoted to the public welfare
<img src="../images/1888363479.jpg" align="right" /> 
by putting the quality of journalism above greed. Publishers knew, says
Squires, that good newspapers "profited less than the bad ones because
good journalism costs more."

But inheritance taxes soon led many newspaper families to either take
their companies public or sell them entirely. Enter, among others,
acquisitions mogul Al Neuharth, an executive with Gannett Co. who,
Squires says, "symbolized the coming of an era of press ownership of an
entirely different nature." Gannett and others of his ilk dangled their
monopoly newspapers in front of Wall Street as, in Neuharth's words, a
"profit machine in good times or bad." And Wall Street bit.

Newspaper ownership, Squires says, gradually passed "into the hands of
corporate managers less concerned with press tradition than with
business profitability." And while corporations gobbled up shares as
fast as papers were offering stock, they also accumulated power, which
they couldn't help but exercise. Corporate culture -- along with its
conformity and morality -- arrived at daily newspapers.

The hard-boiled, chain-smoking editors of old, out to lynch any business
or government agency guilty of treading on the public welfare, gave way
to a new breed of journalists: suit-and-tie wearing executives willing
to cross the formerly sacrosanct line between news and advertising to
turn a bigger profit for the corporate master.

The drive for profits brought a new priority: the unyielding quest for
cost reduction -- which meant cutting back staff, a key determinant of
the quality of news, and curtailing the amount of space given to news,
the key factor in its quantity.





3 "The Dirty Little Secret"
===========================

But, in Squires' view, undermining the quantity and quality of news
isn't corporate journalism's biggest sin. "The dirty little secret," as
Squires puts it, is that newspapers claim the right of access to
government -- courtrooms, records, the president, etc. -- "on the basis
that it is an institution exercising the people's right to know. Never
does it claim the right to such access on the basis that it is in the
business of delivering advertising information for profit."
<img src="../images/willlamette.gif" align="right" />(http://www.willametteweek.com/)

And it gets worse, Squires writes, because newspapers cut costs by
trimming unprofitable circulation among low-income, minority readers to
"improve the overall demographic profile of their audiences, which they
then use to justify raising advertising rates. Thus, with few
exceptions, the profitability of newspapers in monopoly markets has come
to depend on an economic formula that is ethically bankrupt and
embarrassing for a business that has always claimed to rest on a public
trust."





4 A View from the Inside
========================

Although Squires supplies insights that only an industry insider could
provide, he is not the first to document the corporate takeover of the
media, which has been examined in such books as *Manufacturing
Consent*
by Noam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman and *The Media
Monopoly*
by Ben Bagdikian.

Unlike Chomsky, however, Squires stays well clear of a number-crunching,
scholarly approach. Instead he uses his experiences at the Tribune to
illuminate the intricacies of
<img src="../images/bknmmanu.gif" align="right" />
the corporate monopoly on media ownership and its broader effects on
content, including changes in the definition of news, the shaping of
editorial opinions by marketing considerations, the tailoring of the
news to attract advertisers, the shifts toward news as entertainment,
and the conflicts of interest in reporting on businesses under the same
corporate umbrella.

Yet, to his discredit, Squires stops short of taking the leap of Chomsky
and Bagdikian and analyzing whether corporate ownership has fostered a
uniformity of perspective and content.

Nevertheless, the book proves to be fairly interesting reading for
anyone wanting an inside look at how corporate greed is corrupting the
news.
