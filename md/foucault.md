1 Barthes' Anti-Hero
====================

Roland Barthes, writing in the early 1970s, begins *The Pleasure of
the Text* with these words:
<img src="../images/0374521603.gif" align="right" />


> "Imagine someone ... who abolishes within himself all barriers, all
> classes, all exclusions, not by syncretism but by simple discard of
> that old specter: logical contradiction; who mixes every language,
> even those said to be incompatible; who silently accepts every charge
> of illogicality, of incongruity; who remains passive in the face of
> Socratic irony (leading the interlocutor to the supreme disgrace:
> self-contradiction) and legal terrorism (how much penal evidence is
> based on a psychology of consistency!). Such a man would be the
> mockery of our society: court, school, asylum, polite conversation
> would cast him out: who endures contradiction without shame? Now this
> anti-hero exists: he is the reader of the text at the moment he takes
> his pleasure."1

With but a few minor revisions and reservations, this excerpt could be
used to describe Michel Foucault. Barthes, of course, was not explicitly
writing of Foucault, but I find it hard to fathom that he could not have
made the connection, at least fleetingly, as he was composing the
passage. Or, more dramatically, perhaps Barthes had just been reading
Foucault, taking his pleasure, when he had the thought of an anti-hero
reading the anti-hero. For it is Foucault who rises above the Cartesian
*Weltanschauung* to show us what lies beyond its arbitrary structures,
for it is Foucault who reverses the paradigm, making a mockery of court
in *Discipline and Punish* and of asylum in *Madness and
Civilization*.
Taking Barthes's passage in turn, it is
<img src="../images/0374521344.gif" align="right" /><img src="../images/bkmfmad.gif" align="right" />
Foucault who abolishes the exclusions of the past and discards the
arbitrary constraints of reason, Foucault who reexamines and reconnects
aspects of language said to have been irreconcilable, Foucault who
reveals the ultimate philosophical irony: truth often lies not so much
in scientific method, with its birth perhaps in the Socratic method, but
in discourse. Truth, that is, no longer falls within the *logical*
confines of the Socratic method but within the discourse of it, within
an analysis of established categories of language, thought, and history.

But even though the lines of *The Pleasure of the
Text*
excerpted above can be interpreted as Barthes's late-career homage to
Foucault's postmodernism, Foucault would dispute the ability of
semiological analysis to detect a singular, over-arching meaning or myth
under the cloak of signifier and signified, as Barthes and Baudrillard
often attempt to do. In
*Mythologies,*
for<img src="../images/0374521506.gif" align="right" />
example, Barthes writes: "What wrestling is above all meant to portray
is a purely moral concept: that of justice."2 In another essay in
*Mythologies,* Barthes acknowledges the "quick-change artistry of
plastic" but then goes on to say that "plastic is, all told, a spectacle
to be deciphered: the very spectacle of its end-products"3 (with
spectacle being a somewhat technical term meaning "the interplay of
action, representation and alienation in man and in society"4). For
Barthes, plastic becomes the ultimate sign of transmutation: "Plastic,
sublimated as movement, hardly exists as substance."5 In fact:

"The hierarchy of substances is abolished: a single one replaces them
all: the whole world *can* be plasticized, and even life itself since,
we are told, they are beginning to make plastic aortas."6





2 "An Ever-Changing Sameness"
=============================

The media are a bit like plastic themselves: They are, in Max
Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno's words,
"an<img src="../images/bkhorkhe.gif" align="right" />
ever-changing sameness." And, also like plastic, the whole world, life
itself, is being turned into media. Barthes's playfulness
notwithstanding, however, no sign, no word, contains a singular
interpretation for Foucault, even perhaps as metaphor. Not even plastic,
though the word is of course used here by Foucault in its material
sense:

"Between word and image, between what is depicted by language and what
is uttered by plastic form, the unity begins to dissolve; a single and
identical meaning is not immediately common to them. And if it is true
that the image still has the function of speaking, of transmitting
something consubstantial with language, we must recognize that it
already no longer says the *same thing*..."7

Foucault is speaking of painting, but the same might be said about the
mass media, not only of their images but also of their
[signs](the_sign.html), their representations, their references: their
language. Why? A liberation from reason, an unfolding into madness. A
liberation that "derives from a proliferation of meaning, from a
self-multiplication of significance, weaving relationships so numerous,
so intertwined, so rich, that they can no longer be deciphered except in
the esoterism of knowledge. Things themselves become so burdened with
attributes, signs, allusions that they finally lose their own form.
Meaning is no longer read in an immediate perception, the figure no
longer speaks for itself; between the knowledge which animates it and
the form into which it is transposed, a gap widens."8





3 Foucault and Media Analysis
=============================

This excerpt captures quite precisely the application of Foucault's
postmodernism to media analysis. Rendered
<img src="../images/bk_derri.gif" align="right" />
thus, Foucault's theory bears a direct similarity to Derrida's notion of
*differance*: there is at once the difference, or contrast, of [signs in
a structural system](the_sign.html) that produces meaning and the
endless deferral of meaning. That is, there is no "final or fixed point
or privileged, meaning-determining relationship with the extralinguistic
world."9

Hence: there is not much to analyze, for meaning is fleeting,
perspectival, perhaps even self-indulgent, though even that is somewhat
contradictory since there is no subject. Analysis itself, especially of
the kind steeped in reason, becomes irrelevant, an anachronism.
Postmodernism, then, becomes not so much an explanation of media content
as an acknowledgement that there are myriad explanations behind any
particular sign or image: "So many diverse meanings are established
beneath the surface of the image that it presents only an enigmatic
face."10

But perhaps I'm construing Foucault's postmodernism too broadly. For
there is a disjunction of sorts between Foucault's own theory and the
methodology that he uses to analyze histories and texts. Thus, a better
indicator of how Foucault's thought could be used to analyze the mass
media and their relations to society may lie more in his methodology
than in his theory: a questioning and analysis of categorization and its
relations to power, for both are present in abundance in the mass media,
including such categories as objectivity as truth.

How, specifically, does Foucault develop his analyses? First, it is a
genealogy of sorts, and a questioning of the external conditions of
production. The rest of the answer comes from Foucault in *Madness and
Civilization*. In this excerpt the word "media" could be substituted for
the first instance of the word "madness":

"To write the history of madness thus will mean the execution of a
structural study of an historical ensemble -- notions, institutions,
juridical and police measures, scientific concepts -- which holds
captive a madness whose wild state can never in itself be restored."11
