<p><img src="/images/external_link.gif" align="right" /><a href="https://www.transparencynow.com/mediacrit.htm">Principles of Media Criticism</a>: Media criticism is in an undeveloped state, today, largely because the mainstream media allows virtually no open discussion of the subject. Some criticism does get to the public, of course, but most of it is corrupted by the same forces that have turned the rest of the media into a source of manipulation.

<p><i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> <a href="kellner.html">An Analysis of Kellner’s Theory of Media Culture</a>: <img src="/images/0415105706.gif" align="right" /> In an era when the media have grown to be one of the most dominant forms of culture in North American – so dominant, in fact, that the they can now be seen as the pinnacle of commercial culture – an explanatory theory of the media becomes paramount. Yet considering the intimate relationship between culture and media and that, for many, the media have become their culture, a theory that views the media outside the context of culture will be afflicted with myopia. Thus, for completeness, a theory of the media requires a firm connection to culture in its every step. Douglas Kellner, in his book Media Culture: Cultural Studies, Identity and Politics Between the Modern and the Postmodern, sets out to make these connections. <a href="kellner.html">Read more …</a></p>

<p><i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> <a href="the_sign.html">Saussure’s Sign</a>: The sign, the signifier, and the signified are concepts of the school of thought known as structuralism, founded by<img src="/images/0812690230.gif" align="right" /> Ferdinand de Saussure, a Swiss linguist, during lectures he gave between 1907 and 1911 at the University of Geneva. His views revolutionized the study of language and inaugurated modern linguistics. The theory also profoundly influenced other disciplines, especially anthropology, sociology, and literary criticism. The central tenet of structuralism is that the phenomena of human life, whether language or media, are not intelligible except through their network of relationships, making the sign and the system (or structure) in which the sign is embedded primary concepts. As such, a sign – for instance, a word – gets its meaning only in relation to or in contrast with other signs in a system of signs. <a href="the_sign.html">Read more …</a></p>

This will be accomplished in two steps. The first will examine whether the specific views of Tocqueville regarding associations and newspapers and the relations between them are borne out in Putnam’s findings. The second step will examine how Putnam’s findings support Tocqueville’s central hypothesis: That equality is the fundamental condition in a democracy from which others are derived. A final section of the essay will specify several normative implications that may be drawn from Putnam’s findings, especially those outlined in “The Strange Disappearance of Civic America.” <a href="putnam1.html">Read more …</a></p>
