### A Glimpse of Her Stomach

**R**oland Barthes, writing in The Pleasure of the
Text, 
has an explanation for a befuddling recurrence: Why so many people,
including myself, watch so much bad TV even when we know it is awful.
Barthes's answer: pleasure. He elaborates thus:





>"If I judge a text according to pleasure, I cannot go on to say: this
one is good, that bad. No awards, no \`critique'," for this always
implies a tactical aim, a social
usage,
 and frequently an extenuating image-reservoir."





And, more poignantly:





>"It is intermittence, as psychoanalysis has so rightly stated, which is
erotic: the intermittence of skin flashing between two
articles of clothing (trousers and sweater), between two edges (the
open-necked shirt, the glove and the sleeve); it is this flash itself
which seduces, or rather: the stage of an appearance-as-disappearance."
