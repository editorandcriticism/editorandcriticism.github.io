Corporate control is ruining our daily newspapers -- I wrote that
sentence to begin a book review in 1992. Now, in 2007, I find myself
writing the same sentence like this: Corporate control has ruined our
daily newspapers.

And just when the state of media control seemed hopeless, it got worse.
The Federal Communication Commission, after holding public hearings
in which nearly every citizen who testified spoke out against further
media consolidation, passed a proposal by its chairman -- a red-tie
wearing plutocrat -- to allow a corporation to own a television station
and a newspaper in the same city.

In a cynically twisted argument, the commissioner, Kevin J. Martin,
maintained in a press release published on the op-ed page of The New
York Times that the FCC must change the cross-ownership rule to prop up
the financial condition of newspapers because "newspapers are crucial to
our democracy."

Yes, independent, community-owned newspapers are crucial to democracy.
Even some corporate-owned papers such as The New York Times can play an
important role -- when they do their job, which many of them haven't
been doing for at least 8 years, and that's one of the reasons their
readers are leaving them for other channels of information in droves.

Martin's argument is vapid because corporate ownership of newspapers, by
its very nature, radically undermines democracy. Allowing corporations
to own and control more media doesn't protect democracy, as Martin
thinks, but erodes it. Newspapers like the Wall Street Journal, USA
Today, The Oregonian, and The New York Post have been death for
democracy in the United States. Their function is no longer that of a
"watchdog and informer of the citizenry," as Martin writes, but quite
the opposite.

Media conglomerates seek to manipulate citizens so that they can
impose their matrix of plutocracy and unregulated capitalism on an
underinformed or misinformed populace for corporate profit. Chomsky has
called it "manufacturing consent."

But this story isn't just about cultural conformity. Like so much else
in the past 8 years, it is really about *economic royalism*.

Based on what he says in his op-ed piece in The New York Times, the FCC
chairman's worldview is that newspapers serve markets, not places where
people live. Only places where people consume.

It's part of the Bush agenda to push through as much pro-business, anti-democracy
policies as possible before the end of its term. In the meantime, the
concentration of media ownership continues to increase, against what had
been the long-standing policy of the FCC to prevent monopoly ownership
of media.
