title: A PITHY REMARK STEEPED IN ATTITUDE
---


Introduction
============



**T**he Internet, despite being partially a print-based medium, contains
[discourse](/da/) more similar in a crucial way to television than
traditional text: It encourages the written soundbite, the quick shot
from the hip, the pithy remark steeped in attitude. Viewers expect only
this. Anything more, they jump afield. Most of them prefer attitude or
[image over substance](cult1.html), design over content. If you attempt
to address an issue with depth, viewers change the channel. Just like on
TV. So I'll keep this short. But before you continue with your search,
before you follow yet another link that leads only to more links, note
that I, and others, have begun to call Internet users "viewers," not
"readers."


_[Editor's Note: The description above was written in 1997; it still seems to characterize our interactions with the web today.]_



This portion of the site is a magazine of [media criticism](/md/). Some
of it contains indepth, academically oriented content under the rubric
"[theory](theory1.html)." The site aims to provide stand-alone content
on media cultural studies, mass communication, media sociology, and
[sociolinguistics](/linguistics#Sociolinguistics). I'm not talking about
a just a list of links to more links, though it offers some of that too,
but working papers and published essays on these subjects.
