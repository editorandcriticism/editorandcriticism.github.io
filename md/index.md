1 Media Criticism
=====================



<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> [Introduction](intro.html)


<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> [Image over Substance: An Example of
Postmodern Politics](cult1.html): Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno, commenting on Hitler's
propagandistic use of the radio, note "the gigantic fact that the speech
that penetrates everywhere replaces its content,"1 a formula that has
been taken one step further by television: On TV, the image
dominates,<img src="/images/bkhorkhe.gif" align="right" /> overpowering not only the fact of speech but also its content. [Read more ...](cult1.html)

<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> [Why Can't We Stop Watching
TV?](theory1.html) Roland Barthes, writing in The Pleasure of the
Text,
has an explanation for a befuddling recurrence: Why so many people,
including myself, watch so much bad TV even when we know it is awful.
Barthes's answer: pleasure. He elaborates thus: [Read more ...](theory1.html)


<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> [Decoding Web Sites that Function as
Propaganda Machines](terrorism-on-web.html): Since both text and graphics and the interaction between the two are
used as modes of rhetoric in the context of multimedia, classical
rhetoric provides a good basis for a defensive analytical system that
allows users to deconstruct websites with poisonous messages. [Read more

<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> [How the Erosion of Newspaper Journalism Is
Putting Democracy At Risk](knightfall.html)


<img src="/images/external_link.gif" align="right" />[Principles of Media
Criticism](https://www.transparencynow.com/mediacrit.htm): Media criticism is in an undeveloped state, today, largely because the
mainstream media allows virtually no open discussion of the subject.
Some criticism does get to the public, of course, but most of it is
corrupted by the same forces that have turned the rest of the media into
a source of manipulation. (By Ken Sanes,
) [Read more ...](https://www.transparencynow.com/mediacrit.htm)

2 Media Theory
==================



<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> [Foucault: A Lover's Discourse about Madness
and the Media](foucault.html): Roland Barthes, writing in the early 1970s, begins *The
Pleasure of the Text* with these words:

<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> [An Analysis of Kellner's Theory of Media
Culture](kellner.html): <img src="/images/0415105706.gif" align="right" />
In an era when the media have grown to be one of the most dominant
forms of culture in North American -- so dominant, in fact, that the
they can now be seen as the pinnacle of commercial culture -- an
explanatory theory of the media becomes paramount. Yet considering the
intimate relationship between culture and media and that, for many, the
media have become their culture, a theory that views the media outside
the context of culture will be afflicted with myopia. Thus, for
completeness, a theory of the media requires a firm connection to
culture in its every step. Douglas Kellner, in his book Media Culture:
Cultural Studies, Identity and Politics Between the Modern and the
Postmodern,
sets out to make these connections. [Read more ...](kellner.html)

<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> [Saussure's Sign](the_sign.html): The sign, the signifier, and the signified are concepts of the
school of thought known as structuralism, founded
by<img src="/images/0812690230.gif" align="right" />
Ferdinand de Saussure, a Swiss linguist, during lectures he gave between
1907 and 1911 at the University of Geneva. His views revolutionized the
study of language and inaugurated modern linguistics. The theory also
profoundly influenced other disciplines, especially anthropology,
sociology, and literary criticism. The central tenet of structuralism is
that the phenomena of human life, whether language or media, are not
intelligible except through their network of relationships, making the
sign and the system (or structure) in which the sign is embedded primary
concepts. As such, a sign -- for instance, a word -- gets its meaning
only in relation to or in contrast with other signs in a system of
signs. [Read more ...](the_sign.html)


<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> [Using French Social Thought for Media Criticism](media-criticism-with-french-social-thought.html) With a focus on Althusser, Barthes, and Foucault, this essay broadly delineates the theoretical approaches of the three schools in explaining the role of the mass media in society. As I proceed, I enumerate several strengths and weaknesses of each theory and make some comparisons among them. [Read more ...](media-criticism-with-french-social-thought.html)

<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> [Live Show: The Connotations of Visual
Signs](liveshow.html): <img src="/images/0748607781.gif" align="right" />"The
level of connotation of the visual sign, of its contextual reference and
positioning in different discursive fields of meaning and association,
is the point where already coded signs intersect with the deep semantic
codes of a culture and take on additional, more active ideological
dimensions," Stuart Hall writes in his essay "Encoding/decoding."^1^ I
almost know what he means. [Read more ...](liveshow.html)











4 Newspapering
==================



<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> [Relation Between Civic Society and Newspapers
in the Writings of Alexis de Tocqueville and Robert
Putnam](putnam1.html): The purpose of this essay is to demonstrate how Robert Putnam's
findings in Making Democracy Work and in a later study he published on
civic participation in the United States, "The Strange Disappearance of
Civic America," support Tocqueville's views. This will be accomplished
in two steps. The first will examine whether the specific views of
Tocqueville regarding associations and newspapers and the relations
between them are borne out in Putnam's findings. The second step will
examine how Putnam's findings support Tocqueville's central hypothesis:
That equality is the fundamental condition in a democracy from which
others are derived. A final section of the essay will specify several
normative implications that may be drawn from Putnam's findings,
especially those outlined in "The Strange Disappearance of Civic
America." [Read more ...](putnam1.html)
