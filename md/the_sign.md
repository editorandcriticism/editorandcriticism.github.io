## 1 THE SIGN, THE SIGNIFIER, AND THE SIGNIFIED

The sign, the signifier, and the signified are concepts of the
school of thought known as structuralism, founded
by<img src="/images/0812690230.gif" align="right" />
Ferdinand de Saussure, a Swiss linguist, during lectures he gave between
1907 and 1911 at the University of Geneva. His views revolutionized the
study of language and inaugurated modern linguistics. The theory also
profoundly influenced other disciplines, especially anthropology,
sociology, and literary criticism. The central tenet of structuralism is
that the phenomena of human life, whether language or media, are not
intelligible except through their network of relationships, making the
sign and the system (or structure) in which the sign is embedded primary
concepts. As such, a sign -- for instance, a word -- gets its meaning
only in relation to or in contrast with other signs in a system of
signs.

In general, the signifier and the signified are the components of the
sign, itself formed by the associative link between the signifier and
signified. Even with these two components, however, signs can exist only
in opposition to other signs. That is, signs are created by their value
relationships with other signs. The contrasts that form between signs of
the same nature in a network of relationships is how signs derive their
meaning. As the translator of Saussure's Course in General
Linguistics,
Roy Harris, puts it:

"The essential feature of Saussure's linguistic sign is that, being
intrinsically arbitrary, it can be identified only by contrast with
coexisting signs of the same nature, which together constitute a
structured system" (p. x).

In Saussure's theory of linguistics, the signifier is the sound and the
signified is the thought. The linguistic sign is neither conceptual nor
phonic, neither thought nor sound. Rather, it is the whole of the link
that unites sound and idea, signifier and signified. The properties of
the sign are by nature abstract, not concrete. Saussure: "A sign is not
a link between a thing and a name, but between a concept and a sound
pattern" (Course, p. 66).

## 2 LEXICON

At least two other terms are used for signifier and
signified:<img src="/images/bksemio.gif" align="right" />

signifier = signal = signifiant

signified = signification = signifie

## 3 SIGN VS. SYMBOL


Saussure choose the term "sign" over "symbol" because the latter implies
motivation. For Saussure, the sign is arbitrary. Virtually all signs,
Saussure maintains, have only arbitrarily ascribed meanings. Since
Saussure, this notion has been taken as axiomatic in Western linguistics
and philosophy.

## 4 MISTAKES

A common mistake is to construe the signifier and the sign as the
same thing. In my view, another common mistake, perhaps related to the
first, is to speak of a signifier without a signified or a sign, or to
speak of a signified without a signifer or a sign. Used in reference to
Saussure's original
<img src="/images/0060958332.jpg" align="right" /> formulations, both locutions are nonsensical. In language, a lone
signifier would be an utterly meaningless sound or concatenation of
sounds. But it is even more absurd to speak of a signified without
signifier or sign: It would, I believe, have to be a sort of half
thought, something never thought before, a thought that exists solely
outside the domain of language, a fleeting, private, chaotic thought
that makes no sense even to the thinker -- an unthought. Another mistake
is to endow a sign with meaning outside the presence of other signs.
Except as part of the whole system, signs do not and cannot exist.

## 5 EXPANSION BEYOND LANGUAGE

Saussure provides an explicit basis for the expansion of his science
of signs beyond linguistics: "It is possible," he says, "to conceive of
a science which studies the role of signs as part of social life. ... We
shall call it semiology. It would investigate the nature of signs and
the laws governing them. Since it does not yet exist, one cannot say for
certain that it will exist. But it has a right to exist, a place ready
for it in advance."

Roland Barthes is one scholar who took Saussure's counsel to heart. He
helped found the modern science
of<img src="/images/0374521344.gif" align="right" />
semiology, applying structuralism to the "myths" he saw all around him:
media, fashion, art, photography, architecture, and especially
literature. For Barthes, "myth is a system of communication." It is a
"message," a "mode of signification," a "form"
(Mythologies,
p. 109). With a plethora of complexities and nuances, Barthes extends
Saussure's structuralism and applies it to myth as follows:

"Myth is a peculiar system, in that it is constructed from a
semiological chain which existed before it: it is a second-order
semiological system. That which is a sign (namely the associative total
of a concept and an image) in the first system, becomes a mere signifier
in the second. We must here recall that the materials of mythical speech
(the language itself, photography, painting, posters, rituals, objects,
etc.), however different at the start, are reduced to a pure signifying
function as soon as they are caught by myth" (Mythologies, p. 114).

Because of the complexities and nuances of Barthes's semiology, I will
stop here and let you pick up the strand for yourself by reading the
highly informative chapter "Myth Today" in Mythologies.

## 6 A FINAL WORD: THE INDETERMINANCY OF MEANING

<img src="/images/bk_by_da.gif" align="right" />
Regardless of how linguistic signs (and perhaps other signs, too) are
analyzed, meaning may in fact be unrecoverable, both to the analyst and
to the participants in an exchange of signs. It is my belief that
meaning is indeed ultimately indeterminate, a position that bodes well
with what very well be a fact of language. With respect to
indeterminacy, some linguists, postmodern theorists, and analytic
philosophers seem to be in agreement. Brown and Yule, both of whom are
linguists, write that "the perception and interpretation of each text is
essentially subjective."

The postmodern theorists, meantime, hold that every decoding is another
encoding. Jacques Derrida, for example, maintains that the possibility
of interpretation and reinterpretation is endless, with meaning getting
any provisional significance only from speaker, hearer, or observer:
Meaning is
necessarily<img src="/images/bkgenres.gif" align="right" />
projection. Bakhtin, too, says "the interpretation of symbolic
structures is forced into an infinity of symbolic contextual meanings
and therefore it cannot be scientific in the way precise sciences are
scientific."

Both Bakhtin's and Derrida's views are surprisingly not unlike those of
W. V. O. Quine's in "The Indeterminacy of Translation," where Quine
argued that "the totality of subjects' behavior leaves it indeterminate
whether one translation of their sayings or another is correct."

Wittgenstein pays homage to the indeterminacy of meaning as well: "Any
interpretation still hangs in the
air<img src="/images/bklwpi.gif" align="right" />
along with what it interprets, and cannot give it any support.
Interpretations by themselves do not determine meaning."
