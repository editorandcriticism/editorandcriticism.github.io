## 1 Facts and Values

Max Weber thought that "statements of fact are one thing, statements
of value another, and any confusing of the two is impermissible," Ralf
Dahrendorf writes in his essay "Max Weber and Modern Social Science,"
acknowledging that Weber clarified the difference
between <img src="bk_mw_pol.gif" align="right" />
pronouncements of fact and of value. [1](#FOOTNOTE_1) Although
Dahrendorf goes on to note the ambiguities in Weber's writings between
factual analysis and value-influenced pronouncements, he stops short of
offering an explanation for them other than to say that Weber, being
human, could not always live with his own demands for objectivity.
Indeed, Dahrendorf leaves unclear exactly what Weber's view of
objectivity was. More specifically, Dahrendorf does not venture to lay
out a detailed explanation of whether Weber believed that the social
scientist could eliminate the influence of values from the analysis of
facts.

Did Weber believe that, even though facts are one thing and values
another, social and economic facts could be evaluated without the
analysis being influenced by values? And what is the relation of
objectivity to values? Could objectivity, for instance, be used to show
that one value is superior to another? Or does objectivity apply only to
the analysis of facts? Do one's values or perspective stem from human
nature, metaphysical views, personal identity, or is it just as likely
that they are a mere construct of culture?

These questions, and others like them, underlie much that has been
considered ambiguous in Max Weber's writings: His methodology. Since his
death, sociologists and political scientists have been disputing where
Weber stood with regard to
questions <img src="/images/0520035003.gif" align="right" />
concerning the relationship of objectivity to facts and values. "Most of
Weber's commentators," Edward Bryan Portis writes, "have assumed his
advocacy of the fact-value dichotomy, despite his explicit and implicit
assertions to the contrary, because of his numerous statements denying
the ability of science to refute any normative position or to help one
choose among contending normative orientations." [2](#FOOTNOTE_2)
Indeed, hardly a scholarly piece is written on Weber, it seems, without
the preamble that Weber's views on this subject have been widely
misunderstood, with the implication that the scholar at hand intends to
finally set the record straight.

This essay has more humble ambitions. Although it takes issue in the
final section with part of the exhaustive view laid out
by <img src="/images/0415084342.gif" align="right" />
Portis, this essay does not purport to set forth yet another definitive
interpretation of Weber's views on objectivity. Rather it seeks to shed
light on Weber's view of the applicability of objectivity by attempting
to answer the overarching question that sits at the foundation of those
posed above: Was Weber an advocate of value-free social science?

The answer, as will be shown, is both yes and no -- because, this essay
will argue, Weber maintained a two-tiered approach to value-free social
science. On the one hand, he believed that ultimate values could not be
justified "scientifically," that is, through value-free analysis. Thus,
in comparing different religious, political or social systems, one
system could not be chosen over another without taking a value or end
into consideration; the choice would necessarily be dictated by the
analyst's values. On the other
hand, <img src="/images/0195004620.gif" align="right" />
<img src="/images/0521097851.gif" align="right" />
Weber believed that once a value, end, purpose, or perspective had been
established, then a social scientist could conduct a value-free
investigation into the most effective means within a system of bringing
about the established end. Similarly, Weber believed that objective
comparisons among systems could also be made once a particular end had
been established, acknowledged, and agreed upon, a position that allowed
Weber to make what he considered objective comparisons among such
economic systems as [capitalism](/philosophy/max-weber-capitalism.html)
and socialism. Thus, even though Weber maintained that ultimate values
could not be evaluated objectively, this belief did not keep him from
believing that social problems could be scientifically resolved -- once
a particular end or value had been established.

## 2 Stating the Standpoints

But first, just what is Weber's own standpoint, as determined by his
ultimate values? It is, no doubt, influenced by one of his key concerns:
"the quality of human being in any given economic and social order."
[3](#FOOTNOTE_3) Sometimes, however, his standpoint
is <img src="/images/0803975635.gif" align="right" />
nationalistic. And in yet other essays, it champions individual liberty.
Indeed, Weber's perspective changes, and it is likely to be driven not
by one value but by levels of them, ranging from humanism to a concrete
objective. But the fact that Weber had a perspective lends little
support to the two-tiered interpretation, other than to show that he
believed it was permissible for a social scientist to possess a
value-determined standpoint. His treatment of perspective is another
matter, however.

One hint that begins to shed light on Weber's view on the fact-value
question is a characteristic that recurs in several of Weber's essays
and speeches: Weber announces, often at the beginning of a speech or essay, the standpoint
from which he plans to evaluate a given situation or set of facts.
Likewise, if he changes his focus during a presentation, he often
declares the new standpoint. In his opening remarks of "The Nation State
and Economic Policy," one of Weber's early speeches, he sets a precedent
for this pattern while unveiling a justification for his perspective.
The "inaugural lecture is an opportunity," Weber says, "to present and
justify openly the personal and, in this sense, \`subjective' standpoint
from which one judges economic phenomena," revealing that he maintained
that even the examination of such seemingly hard data as economic facts
were subject to the influence of a perspective determined by values.
[4](#FOOTNOTE_4) When Weber shifts
course <img src="/images/3540634584.gif" align="right" />
later in the speech to prescribing what should be done to deal with the
problems on Germany's eastern frontier, he discloses his new
perspective: "the standpoint of the German people." [5](#FOOTNOTE_5) The
solution would obviously be quite different if it were made, say, from
the standpoint of the Polish workers. Similarly, in one of his later
lectures, "The Profession and Vocation of Politics," Weber tells his
audience near the beginning of his remarks that he will expose "the
political deficiency of this system ... from the standpoint of success."
[6](#FOOTNOTE_6)

Although Weber often announces the value from which he intends to
analyze a particular policy, he also acknowledges that the value may be
merely a construct of one's culture or society. An example of the
influence of culture upon perspective lies in Weber's comments about
political economy. As soon as the method of analysis known as political
economy makes value judgments, Weber says, "it is tied to the particular
strain of humankind (Menschentum) we find within our own nature. ... The
economic policy of a German state, and, equally, the criterion of value
used by a German economic theorist, can therefore only be a German
policy or criterion." [7](#FOOTNOTE_7) Yet the perspective still must be
acknowledged.

Regardless of whether a social scientist's value-orientation stems from
cultural norms,
 <img src="/images/0521292689.gif" align="right" />
nationality, or a worldview, what remains certain for Weber is that the
value is neither intrinsic to the subject matter nor specific to its
context -- a view that categorically separates value from facts. Weber
takes care to refute such views in his discussion of the methodology of
political economy in "The Nation State and Economic Policy." First,
Weber assails those economists who maintain that political economy can
derive its own ideals from the subject matter. The notion that there are
independent or socio-political ideals shows itself to be a delusion as
soon as one delves into the literature in an attempt to identify the
basis for its evaluation, Weber says. [8](#FOOTNOTE_8) "The truth is
that the ideals we introduce into the subject matter of our science are
not peculiar to it, nor are they produced by this science itself."
[9](#FOOTNOTE_9) Rather, the values stand above the subject matter; they
are of a higher order. For Weber, it is less important what another
analyst's core values are than whether he clarifies them for the benefit
of both himself and his audience.

Weber also criticizes those scientists who often "unconsciously allow
the starting point for our analyses and explanations of economic events
to determine
our <img src="/images/1859842755.gif" align="right" />
judgements of these events," [10](#FOOTNOTE_10) demonstrating that he
separates the subjectivity of value-orientation from the objective
evaluation that is carried out after the value orientation has been
established. In other words, Weber is chastising those scientists who
allow the subjectivity of their perspective to determine their analysis
of the facts. As examples of the economic scientists who have made this
mistake, Weber points to the historical apologists and to the Marxists.




<a name="s3"></a>


## 3 Adhering to Values

What matters even more to Weber is whether one adheres unflinchingly
to his values. In "The Profession and Vocation of Politics," Weber
explicitly articulates
 <img src="/images/039309040X.gif" align="right" />
how one must look at life from a chosen value: "What matters is not age
but the trained ability to look at realities of life with an unsparing
gaze, to bear these realities and be a match for them inwardly."
[11](#FOOTNOTE_11) The comment exposes the inherent relationship, for
Weber, between value-free analysis and value-driven moral action, a
dichotomy that resurfaces in Weber's discussion of an ethics of
commitment and an ethics of responsibility. To be "a match for them
inwardly" is to cling to one's values even in the face of the inevitable
"polar night of icy darkness." [12](#FOOTNOTE_12) "For truly, although
politics is something done with the head, it is certainly not done with
the head alone." [13](#FOOTNOTE_13) Values are linked to the heart -- to
subjectivity -- as much as they are linked to the head.

Weber himself seems to adhere to his own values -- or at least he argues
repeatedly for the veracity of one \`cause' over another. Perhaps this
is among the trends that have led many Weber scholars astray, especially
since "Weber feels that no cause can be \`proved', simply by
intellectual means, to be superior to any other." [14](#FOOTNOTE_14)
Despite his own attachment to, for example, the values of individual
liberty, his "philosophical stance did not provide a mechanism for
validating democratic values in and of themselves." [15](#FOOTNOTE_15)

How can Weber's arguments for his ultimate values be reconciled with the
view that value-free analysis can be conducted only after a value or
purpose has
been <img src="/images/0521314267.gif" align="right" />
established? Lassman and Speirs, in their introduction to Weber:
Political Writings, provide the answer. "Although Weber believed that
values could not be given any form of \`ultimate' foundation, it was
possible and indeed necessary" [16](#FOOTNOTE_16) to argue for them
because "the tensions between competing values are essential in order to
prevent cultural stagnation." [17](#FOOTNOTE_17) Even though Lassman and
Speirs do not explain precisely how it is possible to put forth
objective arguments supporting subjective values while maintaining a
commitment to truth, they do allude to one solution: Weber's "scholarly
investigations and political essays have the purpose of making clear, in
an objective manner as possible, the realities and possibilities given
in any particular situation." [18](#FOOTNOTE_18)




<a name="s4"></a>


## 4 A Two-Tiered Approach to Value-Free Social Science

Having examined Weber's views of the role of perspective and values
in social scientific analysis, the evidence, both from Weber's writings
and from commentaries on them, must now be considered in support of the
interpretation that Weber took a two-tiered approach to value-free
social science.

First, it must be shown that held Weber believed ultimate values could
not be proved scientifically, a position alluded to in several preceding
remarks. Lassman and Speirs, writing in their introduction to Weber:
Political Writings, address the matter directly. Weber held the belief,
they say, that "there is no longer any possibility of an objective
ranking of ultimate values or moral principles." [19](#FOOTNOTE_19)

Weber's own writings support Lassman and Speirs' conclusion that Weber
considered ultimate values and their subsequent political values to be
subjectively <img src="/images/0807042056.gif" align="right" />
determined. For instance, in "Between Two Laws" Weber writes that
certain communities are able to provide the conditions for not only such
"bourgeois" values as citizenship and true democracy, "but also much
more intimate and yet eternal values, including artistic ones."
[20](#FOOTNOTE_20) The language that Weber uses to characterize these
two types of values leads to the interpretation that he held them to be
a subjective matter. Regarding the first set of values, labeling them
"bourgeois" brings to light their contingent nature: They are the
product of a class, a strata. Regarding the second set, the labels
"intimate" and "eternal" clearly set them apart from any objective
foundation. An "intimate" value is by definition personal, an opinion.
Further: It carries the connotation of emotion, of mystification.
Likewise with "eternal."

This element of mystification, of faith in what is ultimately unknown
and unknowable, materializes in other pieces of evidence that help
substantiate Weber's view that ultimate values cannot be objectively
established. "The nature of the cause the politician seeks to serve by
striving for and using power is a question of faith." [21](#FOOTNOTE_21)
Yet here Weber refers to the politician, not the social scientist. But
could the same theorem not be applied to the social scientist? Could
"social scientist" not be substituted for "politician" and, say, "facts"
for "power"? And then could the social scientist not be asked to use
those facts objectively while maintaining a commitment to his values?
Answering these questions in the affirmative, which can be done only
through an argument by extension, a frail but not hopeless step, leads
to interpreting "The Profession and Vocation of Politics" as a metaphor
for the actions of the social scientist, showing that the values he
seeks to serve are also a question of faith.

The argument by extension notwithstanding, there is other evidence that
Weber held the social scientist's values to be a subjective matter.
Portis, for instance, says Weber "believed it impossible to justify
ultimate values scientifically. He presumed they were derived from the
metaphysical commitments that define one's general outlook."
[22](#FOOTNOTE_22) Rogers Brubaker, in The Limits of Rationality, also
acknowledges that Weber's discussion of value orientations amplifies
those of a long line of ethical relativists. Weber believed that "value
orientations are essentially subjective, and that conflict among them
cannot be rationally resolved." [23](#FOOTNOTE_23)

Furthermore, Weber believed that value orientations could not be
eliminated from social scientific work. They necessarily determine the
analyst's
perspective. <img src="/images/0520056590.gif" align="right" />
Portis writes that Weber, in his Freiburg inaugural address, said
"political economy was a \`political science,' in the sense that it must
proceed from a value perspective." [24](#FOOTNOTE_24) More crucially,
Portis goes on to quote Weber as writing that "\`there is no "objective"
scientific analysis of culture ... or "social phenomena" independent of
special and "one-sided" viewpoints -- expressly or tacitly, consciously
or unconsciously -- they are selected, analyzed, and organized for
expository purposes.'" [25](#FOOTNOTE_25)



<a name="s5"></a>



## 5 Ruling Out Objectivity Prior to Perspective

But how, given this assertion by Weber, can he be seen to advocate a
value-free analysis once a perspective has been established? The first
hint lies in the quotation itself. Weber does say that there is no
objective analysis "independent of special and 'one-sided' viewpoints,"
a remark that does not rule out objectivity, only objectivity prior to a
perspective.

This interpretation of Weber's position derives additional support from
other comments Weber made regarding objectivity. Example: One of the
"deadly sins in the area of politics" is, Weber says, "a lack of
objectivity." [26](#FOOTNOTE_26) The objectivity, however, can engage
only after a value has been established; otherwise, this remark is
logically inconsistent with Weber's statement that "the nature of the
cause the politician seeks to serve by striving for and using power is a
question of faith." The two statements, taken together, imply that once
a political position -- a value or perspective -- has been established,
the politician must hold to the ideal of objectivity. Furthermore,
without resorting to the two-tiered interpretation of Weber's view of
value-free social science, it would be difficult to reconcile Weber's
comment that a lack of objectivity is a sin with the comment that there
is no objective analysis independent of special viewpoints.

Lassman and Speirs supply another piece of evidence for the view that
Weber believed a subjective end had to be established before objective
analysis could proceed. They write: "The \`disenchantment' that Weber
described did not stop with liberalism. The traditional philosophical
foundations of all political ideologies and doctrines were threatened by
a relentless undermining of their own presuppositions." This extract
reveals that Weber, at least in Lassman and Speirs' view, was interested
in analyzing from an objective viewpoint the makeup of various political
systems -- but it also shows that the objective analysis could only be
carried out once the purpose of the system, i.e., the ultimate value
upon which it is based, is identified and acknowledged.

Thus it seems, both by default and implication, that Weber believed the
political analyst could adhere to the principle of objectivity once an
value or perspective had been laid out. In this regard, Weber departs
from -- or rather builds upon -- the philosophy of social science laid
out by Friedrich
Nietzsche, <img src="/images/0140150625.gif" align="right" />
 <img src="/images/0140443290.gif" align="right" />
whose thought influenced Weber. Nietzsche's perspectivism maintains that
all interpretation is necessarily mediated by perspective, making
analysis unavoidably laden with biases, presuppositions, values, and so
forth. Weber builds on Nietzsche's perspectivism by maintaining that
objectivity is still possible -- but only after a particular
perspective, value, or end has been established. For the politician, the
question of value is a choice of a faith; but once it is made, it should
be pursued by objective means. For the social scientist, value
necessarily determines perspective and influences the facts chosen for
analysis, but once those decisions are made, the social scientist is
bound by the principle of objectivity.

The work of Weber scholars supports this conclusion. Brubaker, for
instance, affirms the two-tiered interpretation of Weber's view
regarding objectivity:

> "The selection of means to a given end can be assessed in terms of its
> objective rationality, since it is possible to discriminate
> objectively -- for Weber, scientifically -- between adequate and
> inadequate means. But the notion of objective rationality does not
> apply to wertrational action -- to action conceived as intrinsically
> rather than as instrumentally valuable, as an end in itself rather
> than as means to some further end." 27

Portis agrees, writing that Weber came to believe that empirical
methods, in social science, could distinguish between true and false
beliefs only when researchers took a distinct orientation toward their
own ultimate values. [28](#FOOTNOTE_28)



<a name="s6"></a>



## 6 Establishing a Value Prior to Analysis


On another level, however, Portis also argues that Weber
nevertheless maintained that political activity and social science are
incompatible pursuits, and this is where Portis' interpretation of
Weber's thought on objectivity goes afoul.

Weber, he says, "denied that objectivity would be equated with
impersonality or that it was possible for thought to be
compartmentalized into normative and objective categories."
[29](#FOOTNOTE_29)

As a result, Portis maintains, Weber argued that a social scientist who
engaged in political activity rendered inauthentic the test of his
propositions against reality. Thus, Weber's perspective, Portis
contends, is that politics are autonomous from science both in principle
and in practice.

Portis is partly right. Yet he is also partly wrong. He accurately
portrays Weber's first-level view that denies the existence of either
positive or natural law, affirming the fact-value dichotomy: "The
categories through which social phenomena are perceived must be
radically subjective, derived from priorities that the investigator
brings to work rather than universal laws discovered through <img src="/images/0674001834.jpg" align="right" />  systematic
observation." [30](#FOOTNOTE_30) Portis, however, soon goes astray -- or
just does not go far enough -- in characterizing Weber's view of the
fact-value dichotomy: "Because these categories are antecedent to social
scientific analysis, social problems cannot be scientifically resolved."
[31](#FOOTNOTE_31) True, Weber would agree, categories must be
established prior to analysis. Once established, these categories also
entail ends, and it is by working objectively toward those ends that
allows the social scientist to resolve a given social problem
scientifically.

Moreover, if one accepts Weber's view that objectivity can be applied to
social and economic problems only after a distinct value orientation has
been established, it follows that political action does not corrupt a
social scientist's objectivity as long as the scientist's perspective or
values are explicitly acknowledged.

The crucial element that Portis overlooks is that by choosing
categories, by establishing a value prior to analysis, as the social
scientist must, he is necessarily making decisions that are inherently
political in nature. Given this, the converse of Portis' conclusion in
fact holds: That a social scientist cannot engage in objective analysis
without taking overt political action, because the choice of values is
itself a political act. From this it follows that [science and politics
are, for Weber, not mutually exclusive; rather, they are mutually
inclusive](/cc/kudos.html#section-Robert-D.-Putnam-Cites-Essay-on-Weber).
The social scientist cannot proceed with objective analysis until after
his values or perspective have been established, an act which is
political, whether conscious or not, whether announced to others or not.

<a name="s7"></a>

## 7 Dual Legacy

Thus, despite Portis' ideal vision of Weber's thought to the
contrary, social science and political activity are compatible: The
social scientist, in conducting research and analyzing facts, is
necessarily influenced by his political position, at least to the extent
determined by his ultimate values. Weber knew this, and exhorted his
fellow social scientists to clarify both for themselves and for others
the values driving their investigations. Such a clarification is the
prerequisite to objective analysis of facts with a particular purpose or
value in mind.

Furthermore, again despite Portis' claims to the contrary, part of the
power and allure of Weber lies in the dual legacy that he handed down:
He succeeded, at least in the totality of his work, in being
overtly <img src="bk_mw_pol.gif" align="right" />
political while remaining true to his integrity as a social scientist.
At least one work by Weber -- his short essay titled "The President of
the Reich" -- directly bears this out. And even if, as Portis argues,
Weber did become psychologically tormented by the tension he felt
between his need to voice his political views and his need to feel
integrity as a social scientist, what allowed him, in the end, to
succeed in being both political and scientific was his two-tiered
approach to value-free social science.

Weber sees the damage inherent in failing to openly acknowledge one's
values, and the even greater danger in falling prey to the delusion that
the analyst can evaluate social facts completely independent of own
values. Weber sums up this position in "The Nation State and Economic
Policy": "We in particular succumb readily to a special kind of
illusion, namely that we are able to refrain entirely from making
conscious value judgements of our own." [32](#FOOTNOTE_32) In other
words, when the analyst fails to clarify and consciously acknowledge his
values, it is unlikely that he can conduct the subsequent analysis
impartially. The acknowledgement of a value orientation is the
prerequisite to objective evaluation.
