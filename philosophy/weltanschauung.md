title: Psychoanalysis as Weltanschauung
---



**P**sychoanalysis has indeed gone on to become its own
*Weltanschauung*, rising to an over-arching high theory, to a mythology
that ironically takes it far beyond Freud's own proclaimed scientific
Weltanschauung. Freud subsumed the discipline of psychoanalysis under
the scientific Weltanschauung, arguing that psychoanalysis was not and
should not be its own Weltanschauung:

> "As a specialist science, as a branch of psychology ...
> \[psychoanalysis\] is quite unfit to construct a Weltanschauung of its
> own: it must accept the scientific one."





Yet for many philosophers and literary theorists -- Lacan, Norman O.
Brown, Kaja Silverman -- psychoanalysis has become the overriding
hypothesis that accounts for all our existential facts. And, perhaps
even more ironically, postmodern theorists like Silverman (but not
Lacan) seize on psychoanalysis while rejecting objective science, for no
doubt the same reason that it appealed to Wittgenstein more than 50
years ago: It's mythological power of explanation.





Wittgenstein is against theory, against a Weltanschauung: He believes it
is misguided to attempt to construct one, for in his philosophical work,
at least after *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus*, Wittgenstein renounced
theory.
