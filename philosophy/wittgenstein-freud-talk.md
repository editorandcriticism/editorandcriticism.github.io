<i class="fa fa-paperclip"></i> **Note:** The notes below are from a presentation I gave in a seminar at
CUNY's Graduate School and University Center. The subject of the
presentation is Chapter 1 of Jacques Bouveresse's book *Wittgenstein
Reads Freud*.


1 Introduction
==================

I don't want to bore you to death by merely recounting the contents of
Chapter 1 in <img src="../images/0691034257.gif" align="right" /> Wittgenstein
Reads
Freud,
so this presentation will also include an interpretation that, for me,
underlies the content of this somewhat biographical chapter.





The three most pressing questions that arise from Ch. 1 are these:





1.  

    How can Wittgenstein consider himself a follower of Freud and yet
    criticize him with such force?

    

2.  

    How can Wittgenstein criticize the theoretical foundation of Freud's
    technique yet still hold that it has significant value?

    

3.  

    A more important question lies at the root of the two above: How can
    Wittgenstein call Freud's therapeutic method a mythology and
    acknowledge that his own technique is also a mythology in a similar
    sense -- for neither are based in science -- yet that both his and
    Freud's views either produce knowledge or clarify the nature of
    certain problems. In other words, how can Freud's therapeutic
    methodology, if it isn't backed by science, produce knowledge?

    















------------------------------------------------------------------------

2 Ambivalence
=================



As Bouveresse notes, one problem with interpreting Wittgenstein's
remarks on Freud is that they appear in brief, allusive passages that
are, with the exception of *Conversations on
Freud* <img src="../images/bklwaest.gif" align="right" />,
scattered throughout his writings and notes of his lectures.





Yet one pattern does emerge: Freud's name is often mentioned in broad
philosophical discussions on language, on mythology, and on the
distinctions between reasons and causes and between aesthetic
explanation and causal explanation.





In Chapter 1, Bouveresse begins to make some sense of these scattered
remarks, especially the ambivalence inherent in Wittgenstein's
criticisms of Freud at the same time that Wittgenstein claims to be a
disciple of him. How, Bouveresse seeks to explain, could Wittgenstein
have considered psychoanalysis both important and mistaken.





Perhaps an answer to this questions lies in a remark by Wittgenstein
that is pivotal to my own interpretation. In Culture
and Value,
Wittgenstein writes:
> "In a way, having oneself psychoanalyzed is like eating from the tree
> of knowledge. Knowledge acquired sets us (new) ethical problems; but
> contributes nothing to their solution."

<img src="../images/0226904350.gif" align="right" /> 





On the basis of this remark as well as others by Wittgenstein, I will
argue that Wittgenstein held psychoanalysis to be a method that could
clarify but not resolve not only ethical but also psychological
problems. In other words, for Wittgenstein one of the myths of
psychoanalysis is that even though the insights gained through it can be
beneficial in themselves, the insights do not entail a solution to or
resolution of the problem. In this way, Wittgenstein is dispelling a
myth of psychoanalysis.















------------------------------------------------------------------------

3 Solving vs. Dissolving Problems
=====================================



That Wittgenstein believed psychoanalysis cannot resolve problems forms
part of his basis for calling himself a follower of Freud while
criticizing Freud and viewing his theory as wrong. There are, of course,
problems with this interpretation: As will become apparent, it produces
some ambivalence of its own.





One problem pertains to the distinction between saying a problem is
solved and saying that it has somehow evaporated because, for instance,
it has been pulled out by its linguistic roots, so to speak.





<img src="../images/bk_pi.gif" align="right" /> 
Such a view must also be reconciled with a passage from Philosophical
Investigations in
which Wittgenstein says, somewhat uncharacteristically, that certain
problems of language are indeed "solved." And this remark clashes, to a
certain extent, with another remark in the *Brown Book* where
Wittgenstein says the application of his technique aims to yield a
clarity so complete that the philosophical problem at hand completely
disappears. But if the problem disappears, has it been resolved?





Anyway: I'm not going to worry about this too much just now. Perhaps
some of you will have some comments on it later. Instead, I wanted to
point out some of Wittgenstein's criticisms of Freud, as well as some of
the reasons Wittgenstein may have saw himself as a disciple of Freud.





But first, it may be worth noting that a fundamental difference between
Wittgenstein and Freud pertains to Wittgenstein's view of madness. As
Bouveresse points out, Wittgenstein wondered if the concept of illness
was really appropriate, writing that


>"Madness need not be regarded as an illness. Why shouldn't it be seen as a sudden--more or less sudden--change of character."















------------------------------------------------------------------------

4 Criticisms of Freud from a "Disciple"
===========================================



First, Wittgenstein sees Freud's theory as speculation, not science. On
Page 44 of Conversations on Freud, Wittgenstein writes: "Freud is
constantly claiming to be scientific. But what he gives is
speculation--something prior even to the formation of a hypothesis."





<img src="../images/039300743x.gif" align="right" /> Second,
Wittgenstein, Bouveresse points out, often alluded to the distinction
between the unconscious and conscious as one that would constitute an
additional source of confusion: Wittgenstein's skepticism about the
unconscious clashes with his philosophical method, which holds that
there is nothing "hidden" to bring to the surface but that everything is
in principle immediately accessible at the surface (cf
[structuralism](md/the_sign.html)). In this way, Wittgenstein's
conception of the nature of psychic phenomena, Bouveresse says, does not
mark Wittgenstein as a disciple of Freud (or as a structuralist, for
that matter).





So just what does mark Wittgenstein as a disciple of Freud, especially
given that Wittgenstein thinks that the postulation of the unconscious
-- one of Freud's foremost theoretical moves -- is not only
philosophically misguided but also without scientific basis.





The reasons for Wittgenstein's self-characterization as a disciple of
Freud must be sought elsewhere -- in the application of a technique.















------------------------------------------------------------------------

5 It's All in the Technique
===============================



The technique that Wittgenstein used in his later years was among other
things to clarify the nature of philosophical problems by examining the
language in which they were presented. The language game, used to get at
the root of a problem, sought to analyze the use or function of language
in a particular context.





Bouveresse says that despite Wittgenstein's misgivings about such a
comparison, the reduction of philosophy to a form of psychoanalysis
seems justified. Bouveresse gives additional reasons why the comparison
is justified:

1.  

    "Wittgenstein explicitly compares philosophy with a kind of
    self-analysis that must triumph over certain specific resistances."

    

2.  

    Wittgenstein said, for example, that "Working philosophy ... is
    really more working on oneself. On one's own interpretation. On
    one's way of seeing things."

    

3.  

    In another instance, Wittgenstein said that "philosophy is an
    instrument that is useful only against philosophers and against the
    philosopher in us."

    





<img src="../images/bk_pi.gif" align="right" />In 
this way, then, Wittgenstein can be seen as a follower of Freud --
metaphorically he believed that his work of clarification required the
analysis of the philosophical self, so to speak.





Bouveresse points out there are still other ways, by analogy, in which
Wittgenstein's technique can be seen as making him a follower of Freud:

1.  

    Wittgenstein on occasion advocates a return to the primitive states
    of philosophical problems, to a level at which they are uncluttered
    by the ravages of time and prior analysis.

    

2.  

    And, like the therapeutic practice of the psychoanalyst, the
    practice of Wittgenstein's philosophical technique aims to identify
    and eliminate the causes of trouble.

    





But this raises yet another Question: If Wittgenstein's technique is not
based upon theory at all, and Freud's technique is based upon a
ill-begotten theory, how can we know that their techniques have
identified the right problems or eliminated the correct causes of
trouble? Must we just take it as a matter of faith or intuition that
they have?















------------------------------------------------------------------------

6 Theoretical Issues
========================



<img src="../images/bklwaest.gif" align="right" /> Yet
Wittgenstein came to harshly criticize aspects of many of the
theoretical notions upon which Freud's technique was founded:

1.  

    Freud was convinced that there had to be one correct explanation of
    psychological behavior and that he had found it. Wittgenstein held
    that there was not and could not be a single explanation for such
    varied behavior. Wittgenstein believed that Freud's theory, like
    Darwin's, did not contain sufficient explanatory power to account
    for the vast range of phenomena.

    

2.  

    In this way, Wittgenstein's attitude was one of "unproductive
    skepticism" compared with Freud's creative dogmatism,
    Bouveresse says.

    

3.  

    Wittgenstein did not formulate a philosophical theory so much as a
    technique for clarifying its problems. Indeed, for Wittgenstein, the
    need to formulate a theory is itself a misguided intention. A theory
    based on the notion that there must be one correct explanation would
    be, for Wittgenstein, a myth. He was more interested in how he could
    see connections.

    

4.  

    And a technique, based upon such a theory, is the application of
    a mythology. But for Wittgenstein, that doesn't mean the technique
    is without value.

    















------------------------------------------------------------------------

7 A Powerful Mythology
==========================



And here is the crucial difference for Wittgenstein. Although he
believed Freud's theory to be unscientific and misguided, he believed
that the mythology it produced could be used to clarify psychological
problems just as his philosophical technique, which was also in no way
based upon a science, could shed a clarifying light on age-old
philosophical problems. through the application of psychoanalysis, as
well as Wittgenstein's language game technique, "bumps" are uncovered
that make one see the value of discovery.





But it is knowledge of the self, for the self -- like religious or
aesthetic knowledge - that lies outside the category of the scientific.

1.  

    In connection to this view, Bouveresse writes \[p. 19\]: "There is
    no science that accounts for the illusions to which philosophy falls
    victim, and no scientifically established technique that can free
    philosophic understanding from the obsessive and false analogies
    which are at the source of the insoluble problems it confronts."

    

2.  

    <img src="../images/bkmonk.gif" align="right" />Thus,
    a technique, a "way of seeing" or "way of speaking" -- even a
    mythological one -- may provide a powerful means by which to clarify
    philosophical or psychological problems.

    

3.  

    But note that the application of such techniques produces a
    clarification, not a resolution. The insights produced when the self
    is seen through the lens of a myth can be immensely enlightening.
    Clarification, however, does not entail resolution. It just alters
    the way the problem is seen. the problem remains, as Bouveresse puts
    it, insoluble.

    

4.  

    Thus, to conclude, as Ray Monk puts it in his biography of
    Wittgenstein, "Freud's explanations are akin to the elucidation
    offered by Wittgenstein's own work. They provide, not a causal,
    mechanical theory, but, paraphrasing Wittgenstein, a way to give up
    one way of thinking and adopt another.

    





This makes a start at answering the three questions I posed at the
beginning of this talk. Perhaps the first two have been answered
sufficiently. But what about the third question? Any thoughts?
