1 Dreams
========

**Dreams.** Freud, Wittgenstein says, held that "all dreams are wish
fulfillments." Wittgenstein, on the other hand, holds that "it is
probable ... there is no single line of explanation for all of them"
("Conversations on Freud," p. 47).

**Interpretation as Meaning.** For Freud, the meaning of a dream could
often be revealed through the interpretation of it. For Wittgenstein,
"any interpretation still hangs in the air along with what it
interprets, and cannot give it any support. Interpretations by
themselves do not determine meaning" ([Philosophical
Investigations],
No. 198).

**Reductionism.** Freud was misguided, Wittgenstein says, in that he
"wanted to find some one explanation which would show what dreaming is.
He wanted to find the essence of dreaming" (L&C, p. 48).





2 Science
=========

**Science.** Freud considered his approach to be scientific. Wittgenstein
considered both his and Freud's approach to be philosophical, not
scientific.

**Weltanschauung.** Freud's agenda, Bouveresse says, was "to eliminate
metaphysics in favor of the 'scientific' conception of the world."
Wittgenstein thought such agendas naive.

**Theory.** Freud attempted to construct a theory that explained the
range of psychological behavior. Wittgenstein thought misguided the
construction of a single philosophical theory, and he may have thought
that psychoanalysis lacked the power to explain the range of psychic
behavior.





3 Traits and Teachings
======================

**Courage.** Wittgenstein saw courage, a trait he valued highly, in
Freud's originality and ingeniousness.

**Cleverness.** Wittgenstein often remarked that Freud was clever, a view
that contains, as Bouveresse points out, an element of implicit
criticism -- and also of self-criticism, for Wittgenstein often feared
that he, too, was only clever, rather than wise, the trait for which he
strived. Wittgenstein says: "Wisdom is something I never would expect
from Freud. Cleverness, certainly; but not wisdom" (Lectures and
Conversations, p. 41).

**Danger to the Public.** Bouveresse notes that Wittgenstein compared the
"incalculable harm" Freud had done to the harm he himself had probably
done to philosophy -- both of their enterprises allowed anyone to claim
they could treat philosophical or psychological maladies. Wittgenstein
once remarked that his and Freud's "teachings, like wine, had made
people drunk. They did not know how to use the teaching soberly."

**Creation of a School.** Freud, Bouveresse says, thought it
indispensable to create a school to spread his ideas, whereas
Wittgenstein did not believe that philosophy had new truths to
communicate and did not want to create a school.

**[The Myth of Psychoanalysis: Wittgenstein
Contra Freud](../md/tech.html)** My central thesis is that if, as Wittgenstein says, Freudian
psychoanalysis is based in myth, its application to actual psychological
problems does not, indeed cannot, resolve them. Instead, all it can do
is clarify them or present them in a different light. Implicit in my
argument is that this is how Wittgenstein thought of the results of
psychoanalysis, much like he thought of the application of his
philosophical technique to philosophical problems, especially those of
metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics. As such, Wittgenstein is also
subverting a larger myth: that the insights gained in psychoanalysis
lead to the scientific resolution of psychological problems. [Read on ...](../md/tech.html)

**[A Wittgensteinian Approach to Discourse Analysis](../da/lw_da.html)** This essay seeks to take Wittgenstein's influence on discourse analysis
a step further by using his writings as the theoretical foundation for
an approach to analyzing discourse that is distinct from speech act
theory,

[<img src="../images/0816612285.gif" align="right" />]
which stems from the analytic tradition in philosophy, and to suggest
that a Wittgenstein-inspired approach may actually be closer in spirit
and content to that of an unlikely candidate whose views, in contrast to
the analytic school, harbor a distinctly Continental flavor which has
come to influence critical theory: Mikhail Bakhtin. [Read on ...](../da/lw_da.html)
