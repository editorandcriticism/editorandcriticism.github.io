1 Philosophy
================



<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i>  **[Max Weber's View of Objectivity in Social
Science](/md/weber1.html)** <img src="https://www.criticism.com/md/bk_mw_pol.gif" align="right" /> Did Weber believe that, even though facts are one thing and values
another, social and economic facts could be evaluated without the
analysis being influenced by values? And what is the relation of
objectivity to values? Could objectivity, for instance, be used to show
that one value is superior to another? Or does objectivity apply only to
the analysis of facts? Do one's values or perspective stem from human
nature, metaphysical views, personal identity, or is it just as likely
that they are a mere construct of culture? [Read on ...](/md/weber1.html)





<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i>  **[Interpretation and Indeterminancy in
Discourse Analysis](https://www.criticism.com/da/da_indet.html)** <img src="/images/0631166238.gif" align="right" />
Throughout the essay, I will argue a hard line: the exact meaning of a
speaker's utterance in a contextualized exchange is often indeterminate.
Within the context of the analysis of the teacher-pupil exchange, I will
argue for the superiority of interactional linguistics over speech act
theory because it reduces the indeterminacy and yields a more principled
interpretation, especially when the interactional approach is
complemented by elements from other sociologically influenced methods,
namely the ethnography of communication and Labovian sociolinguistics. [Read on ...](https://www.criticism.com/da/da_indet.html)





<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i>  **[Habermas' Theory of Discourse
Ethics](habermas-ethics.html)**





The purpose of this essay is to reveal the central distinctive
elements of JÃ¼rgen Habermas' theory of discourse ethics and how his
moral theory differs from those of two other prominent philosophers,
Immanuel Kant and John Rawls. In unveiling the distinctive qualities of
Habermas' discourse ethics, the fundamental difference between it and
Kant's moral theory, upon which Habermas in part bases his thought, will
be explained. Next, in exposing another distinctive element of discourse
ethics, a pivotal difference between Habermas' moral theory and John
Rawls' theory of justice will be elucidated. [Read on ...](habermas-ethics.html)





<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i>  **[Hermogenes Was Right, Socrates
Wrong](https://www.criticism.com/linguistics/cratylus.html)** In Harris and Taylor's chapter on Plato's "Cratylus" in Landmarks in
Linguistic Thought, Cratylus takes the position that the form and
meaning of a word are inextricably related. For Cratylus, "everything,"
including Hermogenes, "has a right name of its own, which comes by
nature" even though some people, like Hermogenes, are named incorrectly
(Cratylus 383, as quoted in Harris and Taylor, p. 1). [Read on ...](https://www.criticism.com/linguistics/cratylus.html)

2 Wittgenstein
==================



<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i>  **[The Myth of Psychoanalysis: Wittgenstein Contra Freud](/md/tech.html)** My central thesis is that if, as Wittgenstein says, Freudian
psychoanalysis is based in myth, its application to actual psychological
problems does not, indeed cannot, resolve them. Instead, all it can do
is clarify them or present them in a different light. Implicit in my
argument is that this is how Wittgenstein thought of the results of
psychoanalysis, much like he thought of the application of his
philosophical technique to philosophical problems, especially those of
metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics. As such, Wittgenstein is also
subverting a larger myth: that the insights gained in psychoanalysis
lead to the scientific resolution of psychological problems. [Read on ...](/md/tech.html)

and Criticism](wittgenstein-freud.html)**





 <i class="fa fa-file-text"></i>  **[A Wittgensteinian Approach to Discourse
Analysis](https://www.criticism.com/da/lw_da.html)** This essay seeks to take Wittgenstein's influence on discourse
analysis a step further by using his writings as the theoretical
foundation for an approach to analyzing discourse that is distinct from
speech act theory, <img src="images/bkgenres.gif" align="right" />
<img src="images/0816612285.gif" align="right" />
which stems from the analytic tradition in philosophy, and to suggest
that a Wittgenstein-inspired approach may actually be closer in spirit
and content to that of an unlikely candidate whose views, in contrast to
the analytic school, harbor a distinctly Continental flavor which has
come to influence critical theory: Mikhail Bakhtin. [Read on ...](da/lw_da.html)

3 Social and Political Philosophy
=====================================



<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i>  **[The Relation Between Civic Society and
Newspapers in the Writings of Alexis de Tocqueville and Robert
Putnam](/md/putnam1.html)** The purpose of this essay is to demonstrate how Robert Putnam's
findings in Making Democracy Work and in a later study he published on
civic participation in the United States, "The Strange Disappearance of
Civic America," support Tocqueville's views. This will be accomplished
in two steps. The first will examine whether the specific views of
Tocqueville regarding associations and newspapers and the relations
between them are borne out in Putnam's findings. The second step will
examine how Putnam's findings support Tocqueville's central hypothesis:
That equality is the fundamental condition in a democracy from which
others are derived. A final section of the essay will specify several
normative implications that may be drawn from Putnam's findings,
especially those outlined in "The Strange Disappearance of Civic
America." [Read on ...](/md/putnam1.html)





<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i>  **[Durkheim on Educational
Systems](durkheim-on-education.html)** In Emile Durkheim's view, educational systems reflect underlying
changes in society because the systems are a construct built by society,
which naturally seeks to reproduce its collectively held values,
beliefs, norms, and conditions through its institutions. Thus, as time
unfolds, educational systems come to contain the imprint of past stages
in the development of society, as each epoch leaves its imprint on the
system. By uncovering these imprints and analyzing them, the development
of a society can be reconstructed from the educational system. [Read on ...](durkheim-on-education.html)
