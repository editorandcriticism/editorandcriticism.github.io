title: 'Goals in Reading Max Weber\''s Early Works'
---

Here are a few goals and questions to keep in mind while reading Max
Weber\'s early works:



* What\'s in these writings for us?
What of these writings can we use in our social and political theories,
for organizing society, for comparative politics? In other words, what
is the contemporary significance of the essays?



* What were the political questions
Weber addressed? What issues? And how did he analyze them? Can we carry
over his methodology and apply it to analyzing today\'s political
societies and cultures? These questions on analysis and methodology are
particularly important because Weber can be considered to be among the
early founders of modern social science.



* What is distinctive about Weber\'s
methodology? How does Weber analyze social, economic, and cultural
change? In particular play, what role do cultural factors play in
Weber\'s methodology and analysis?



* Given that Weber\'s early
methodology is of importance to us, the question then becomes: What
characterized his method of analysis?



* What are the specific aspects of
his comparative method?



* If Weber is using an interpretative
approach, the following questions come to mind in attempting to clarify
the nature of the analysis:

-   From what sociopolitical and economic perspective is Weber analyzing
    German politics and society?
    

-   What was the Zeitgeist and how could it have influenced Weber\'s
    interpretation?
    

-   Under whom did Weber study and what political philosophers did he
    hold in high esteem? Which influenced his thought?
    

-   What was the influence of recent German history on Weber?
    

-   Is there a pattern of analysis underlying Weber\'s interpretations?
