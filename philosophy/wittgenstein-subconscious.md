<i class="fa fa-paper-plane" aria-hidden="true"></i> **I**n his Lectures, Cambridge 1932-1935, Wittgenstein says that \"What
Freud says about the subconscious sounds like science, but in fact it is
just a *means of representation*.\"1 Bouveresse addresses this
assertion: \"What interests me is his way of suggesting that the
hypothesis of the unconscious is merely a manner of speaking, which
could in principle be discarded without any challenges to what Freud is
*really* saying.\"2


But, taking in the whole of his remarks on Freud, it becomes evident
that Wittgenstein sees psychoanalysis itself, not just the unconscious,
as \"a means of representation.\"



Bouveresse, as well as Descombes in the forward to Wittgenstein Reads
Freud, both attest that Wittgenstein saw psychoanalysis as a way of
speaking. Monk, too, comes to the conclusion that Wittgenstein viewed
the entire project of psychoanalysis, not just the unconscious, as a way
of speaking.

\"Freud\'s explanations,\" Monk writes, \"have more in common with a
mythology than with science. \... Freud\'s explanations, then, are akin
to the elucidations offered by Wittgenstein\'s own work.\"3 Monk goes on
to quote Wittgenstein\'s remark that people, in accepting the
explanations of psychoanalysis, \"have given up one way of thinking and
adopted another.\"



Wittgenstein himself readily applied the view to other aspects of
psychoanalysis besides the unconscious. He said, for instance, even a
dream could be looked at \"as a kind of language. A way of saying
something.\"4
