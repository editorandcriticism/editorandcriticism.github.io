# Philosophy Becomes Psychotherapy

It  is not unprecedented that a school of philosophical thought is
turned into a method of psychotherapy. Sartre, for instance, theorized
about developing a form of therapy called existential psychoanalysis,
and Rollo May used the writings of Sartre and other existentialists to
establish it. The approach emphasizes the need for understanding
patients through grasping their total orientation toward the world and
helping them realize their freedom of will and ability to determine
their own destiny.

In America's current cultural climate, in these dog days of advanced
capitalism when we medicate rather than substantiate, isn't that a blast
of fresh air? A holistic approach to understanding your situation that
empowers you to change it.
