How to Write SEO-Friendly URLs
------------------------------

**I**ncluding the topic, the subtopic, and a descriptive file name in a
web page's URL fosters search engine optimization (SEO). Because the
words that appear in your directory path and file name are indexed by
search engines and are searchable, using the names of the directories in
the path to classify the content and the file name to describe its
subject can bolster a page's standing in search engine results.

In an SEO-friendly URL, the directory path identifies the topic and
subtopic of the page and the file name concisely describes its focus. An
SEO-friendly URL, then, breaks down like this:

`http://www.domain.com/topic/subtopic/description-of-content.html`

The topic, or highest-level category, and the subtopic, or the
subcategory, should be short, typically a one-word keyword. The
description of the file's content should also be as short as possible,
with multiple words separated by hyphens. All the characters in the URL
are set in lowercase. Avoid numbers and special characters, which are
hard to read and often don't make sense to users. Here's an example of a
URL that meets these URL guidelines:

`http://www.criticism.com/cc/racing/world-cup-schedule.html`

There is probably an inverse relationship between the effectiveness of
using keywords in a URL and the length of the URL: The longer the URL
and the more keywords it contains, the less useful it is likely to be
for search engine optimization. A best practice, I believe, is to keep
URLs short by limiting them to the domain, a top-level category, a
subcategory, and a descriptive file name.

Long URLs are unsightly, the product of an untidy mind. What's good for
SEO is also good for users: Short URLs are easier to read, easier to
manage, easier to remember, and easier to talk about. More: Using
descriptive categories in URLs exposes the structure of your site,
simplifying site navigation and making it intuitive for users to find
the information they want because the name of each directory, or folder,
classifies the content it contains. To find a menu page, users can just
type the domain name and the obvious name of the topic they want in the
browser's address bar. Example:

`http://www.criticism.com/linguistics/`

Many of these URL guidelines, which benefit both SEO and users, expose
the weaknesses of using dynamic or nonpermanent URLs for
content-oriented web sites.




### The Shortcomings of Dynamic URLs

Dynamic URLs of the type generated by content management systems are
offensive on several levels, violating many of the best practices
discussed above:

-   Dynamic URLs undermine SEO efforts because they typically do not
    contain keywords.
-   Dynamic URLs hide the structure of your web site from users.
-   Dynamic URLs are hard to remember and may be hard to share; they are
    certainly difficult to refer to in a conversation with
    another person.
-   Some dynamic URLs are not permanent and are bookmarked only in vain.
-   Dynamic URLs make site navigation difficult: Users cannot change a
    URL to access a menu page, for example, by editing the address bar
    from
    `http://www.criticism.com/cc/racing/world-cup-schedule.html` to
    `http://www.criticism.com/cc/`.






### The Art of Information Architecture

Aligning the folders in your directory path with the structure of your
web site not only improves SEO but also eases navigation -- each
category naturally contains a menu page for the topic in its folder.
SEO-friendly URLs coincide with user-friendly navigation.

The web site of *The New York Times* provides an example. It organizes
its content by topic -- often starting with a traditional news category,
such as sports -- and then by subtopic, such as baseball, hockey,
soccer, and so forth. The SEO-friendly URL for the menu page of the
sports section is http://www.nytimes.com/pages/sports/, but shortening
it to http://www.nytimes.com/sports/ displays the menu page, too. And
the URL for a sports subtopic, tennis for example, is
http://www.nytimes.com/pages/sports/tennis/.






### Summary

A hierarchical structure that includes main topics and subtopics, all
identified by their folder names, shows both readers and search engines
where your information resides, helping search engines accurately
categorize your site's content. In addition, the descriptive folder and
file names are indexed by search engines and are searchable. In this
way, using descriptive paths and file names in your URLs can improve
your site's ranking in search engines. ![End Icon](/images/endbox.gif)
