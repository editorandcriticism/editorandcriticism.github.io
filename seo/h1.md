Summarize Your Page's Content with the Top-Level HTML Heading Tag
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Beginning your web page with a heading that summarizes your content and
setting the heading in the HTML `H1` tag can help foster search engine
optimization, or SEO. The top of every web page that you want to
optimize for SEO should, in my opinion, start with a pithy H1 heading
that accurately summarizes the page's content. Using an `H1` tag -- the
top-level heading in HTML -- for the first headline helps reveal your
web page's structure to search engines and helps improve your natural
search results.

The H1 heading comes shortly after the opening `body` tag, like this:

``` {space="preserve"}
<html>
...
<body>
<h1>Begin Each Page with an H1 Header</h1>
...
```

Think of the first heading as a headline above a story in a newspaper.
The type of the first headline is typically larger and bolder than the
story's other headings -- subheads. The top-level heading typically
summarizes the information provided in the story. The subheads, in turn,
provide increasingly specific information that expands on the top-level
heading.

The newspaper story is competing with other stories on the page for your
attention. A pithy, accurate headline draws your attention to the story.
The same competition takes place when a search engine displays a
[title](title.html) of a page in a list of titles for similar pages.
Pages with compelling, accurate, and unique titles tend to draw the
attention of surfers, just as news stories with compelling headlines
draw the attention of readers.

Do not use the same H1 heading for every page in your web site: It is, I
believe, a critical error that will undermine your SEO efforts. Instead,
write a unique, accurate heading that summarizes your page and
explicitly inform search engines that it is the top-level heading of the
page by setting it in an `H1` tag.

Typically, the text in your `H1` tag should match or closely resemble
the text that is set in your page's [title](title.html) tag, which
appears in the header of your HTML, so that the code looks something
like this:

``` {space="preserve"}
<html>
 <head>
 <title>Begin Each Page with an H1 Header</title>
 ...
</head>
<body>
 <h1>Begin Each Page with an H1 Header</h1>
...
```

In addition, using the other [HTML heading
tags](html-heading-tags-structure.html) -- H2 through H6 -- to explicitly
delineate the hierarchical structure of your web page's information can
also help foster search engine optimization. Setting your second-level
headings in an H2 tag, for example, can make the hierarchical
relationship of the information explicit not only to readers but also to
search engines. In turn, the information in a nested section with an H3
heading builds on or expands on the information contained under an H2
heading.

Using HTML heading tags to reveal the structure of your information can
help improve your web page's ranking in search engines such as Google.
