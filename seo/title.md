Describe Your Page's Content with a Concise, Compelling Title
-------------------------------------------------------------

Writing a unique, accurate title and placing it in the HTML header of
your web page is a key step in the process of search engine
optimization, or SEO. The header of every web page that you want to
optimize for SEO should contain a title that summarizes the content of
the page in a few compelling words. This article describes how to use a
title to optimize content-based web pages, as opposed to menu pages and
home pages, to improve your natural search results.

The title goes in the `title` tag within the HTML `head` element near
the beginning of the page's code, like this:

``` {space="preserve"}
<html>
 <head>
 <title>A Snappy, Descriptive Title </title>
 ...
</head>
<body>
 ...
```

Examples of snappy, descriptive titles abound in the headlines of
mass-circulation newspapers such as *The New York Times*. Just as with a
newspaper headline, the text in your title is tailored to represent
exactly what the content of your page is about. -- not what your web
site is about. It's all too easy to use the same title for every page in
your web site, but it's a critical mistake that will undermine your SEO
efforts.

A good newspaper headline draws the attention of readers. The same
applies to the titles that appear in a search engine's list of results.
A good title will make people want to view the web page.

It's also a good idea to limit the text of your title to no more than
about 66 characters, including spaces. In the search results of the
world's most important search engine, Google, the text in the title tag
is cut off after 66 characters and replaced with an ellipsis.

Typically, the text in your `title` tag should match or closely resemble
the [first heading](h1.html), preferably set in the [H1](h1.html) tag,
that you display on your web page, or be a shortened version of your
first heading if it is longer than 66 characters.

**Summary**

-   Every web page should include a title to help optimize the page for
    search engines.

-   The title text appears in the `title` tag within the HTML `head` tag
    of your HTML document.

-   The title accurately and concisely describes what the page is about
    in plain language.

-   The title is unique -- it represents the content of the page and not
    something else, like the theme of your web site or the name of your
    company or product. Do not use generic titles. The title of each web
    page in a web site is specific to the content of that page.

-   The title's text is no more than 66 characters, including spaces

-   The text in the `title` tag is identical to or closely resembles the
    text of the page's [first heading](h1.html).

    The title is compelling: It makes people who see the title in search
    results want to view the web page.

Following these simple rules can help improve your web page's ranking in
search engines such as Google and Bing.
