title: 'Vachek\''s Definition of Written Language'
---

Here are a few highlights, including a definition of written language,
from Ch. 1 of Vachek, Josef. 1973. Written Language: General Problems
and Problems of English. The Hague: Mouton.

In Ch. 1, The Pre-Functionalist Views of Written Language, Vachek
defines written language, tentatively, as \"the system of grammatical
means employed for the purpose of producing written utterances
acceptable in the given language community.\" p. 9.

Vachek speaks of a [system](/md/the_sign.html): Each grapheme, or
typographical mark, \"belonging to that system is mainly characterized
by being different from the other graphemes of that system.\" p. 9. \"At
the same time, the rules governing the use of these graphemes \... have
a clearly normative character \... and any use contrary to these rules
is felt as contrary to the norm\" and evaluated as a mistake or
deliberate variation. p. 9.

And the Baudouin de Courtenay 1881 remarks are remarkable for
considering \"written utterances as structures of their own kind.\" p.
12.

Indeed: A productive course of research into how writing can better be
taught might be to consider the structure of texts.
