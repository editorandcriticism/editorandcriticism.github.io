Can the findings of discourse analysis about the coherence and structure
of written texts contribute to the teaching of writing?





As Odlin (1989: 58) points out,





> Differences related to expectations about coherence in discourse may
> create special problems for learners in their reading or listening

More specifically: How do differences in standards of logicality and
relevance among speech communities within the same language affect their
production and understanding of written communication?





Or, perhaps more to the point, when will educators abandon their
misguided emphasis on prescriptive grammar in favor of the *structural
properties* of written texts?
