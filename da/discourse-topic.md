The concept of discourse topic also emerged from the theoretical
framework of the Prague School linguists. In particular, as Witte
(1983a) points out, Frantisek Danes showed that topics of successive
sentences can be identified in relation to what Danes called a
"hypertheme," in effect a discourse topic, which may or may not be
explicitly stated in the text. The discourse topic is what the text,
taken as a whole, is about.

Lautamatti (1978) demonstrates the relationship between sentences in a
text and discourse topic. Sentence topics, which are units of meaning
organized hierarchically in the text, make a semantic contribution to
the development of the discourse topic. Lautamatti (1978: 71) puts it
thus:

 >"The development of the discourse topic within an extensive piece of
 discourse may be thought of in terms of a succession of hierarchically
 ordered subtopics, each of which contributes to the discourse topic,
 and is treated as a sequence of ideas, expressed in the written
 language as sentences. We know little about restrictions concerning
 the relationship between sentences and subtopics, but it seems likely
 that most sentences relating to the same subtopic form a sequence. The
 way the written sentences in discourse relate to the discourse topic
 is ... called topical development of discourse."
