	Grice's Cooperation Principle and Conversational Maxims
---




1 Cooperation Principle
=======================

Conversational Maxims and Implicatures are the foundation of the
philosopher H.P. Grice's pragmatic account of communication. To account
for the distinction between what is directly said and what is conveyed
by an utterance, Grice proposed that in conversing, participants proceed
according to an implicit assumption that he terms the *cooperative
priniciple*:

> "Make your conversational contribution such as is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged."



2 Conversational Maxims
=======================

Another set of assumptions, called conversational maxims, underlie the
cooperative priniple:


	1.  Quality: Try to make your contribution 
	        one that is true. 
	(1) Do not say what you believe to be false.
	(2) Do not say that for which you lack 
	        adequate evidence.

	2.  Quantity
	(1) Make your contribution as informative as is 
	        required for the current purposes of the exchange.
	(2) Do not make your contribution more informative 
	        than is required. 

	3.  Relation: Be relevant. 

	4.  Manner: Be perspicuous.
	(1) Avoid obscurity of expression.
	(2) Avoid ambiguity.
	(3) Be brief (avoid unnecessary prolixity).
	(4) Be orderly. 



3 Meanings Beyond What Is Said
==============================

Grice demonstrates that conversational participants convey meanings
beyond that which is said if they assume that the other is adhering to
the cooperative principle and its maxims. Conversationalists can deal
with the maxims in several ways: They can follow them, violate one of
them, opt out of one of them, sacrifice one to the other if they clash,
or flout them. Lying, for example, violates the maxim of quality. The
maxims derive their explanatory power from what happens when behavior
appears not to conform to them. Thus, as Green (1989) explains, since
speakers assume that hearers adopt the cooperative principle and its
maxims for interpreting speech behavior, the speaker is free to exploit
it, and to speak in such a way that his behavior must be interpreted
according to it. If the speaker's remark seems irrelevant, the hearer
will attempt to construct a sequence of inferences that make it relevant
or at least cooperative. This exploitation of the maxims is the basic
mechanism by which utterances are used to convey more than they
literally denote, and Grice called it implicature.



4 A Normative Theory?
=====================

Acts of language that run counter to Grice's Conversational Maxims are
termed violations. But if we find a culture in which violations rather
than the maxims are the norm, the theory loses much of its explanatory
power. The violations may in fact not be violations at all, and acts in
accordance with the maxims may actually become violations. Perhpas it is
not a theory at all, but a normative model -- an unintended prescription
for using language.
