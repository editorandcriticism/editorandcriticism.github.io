---

Here are a few highlights from Ch. 2 of Vachek, Josef. 1973. Written
Language: General Problems and Problems of English. The Hague: Mouton.



Valchek sees a \"momentous step\" forward when Artymovyc \"claims for
written language a status to a degree independent of that of spoken
language.\" p. 14.



Indeed, Vachek says, the appropriate enquiry is to try to find out the
functional justification of the existence of written language. p. 15.
\"The written norm of language has its functional justification
alongside the spoken norm: in some specific situations the former can
serve the communicative needs of the members of a community better than
the latter.\" p. 16.



The two norms, Vachek says, appear to be functionally compementary: one
or the other will be found more appropriate to use in a given situation.
p. 16
