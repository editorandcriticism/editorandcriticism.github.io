1 Definition
============

Ethnomethodology is "the study of common social knowledge, in particular
as it concerns the understanding of others and the varieties of
circumstance in which it can take place." -- Simon Blackburn,
<img src="/images/0192831348.gif" align="right" /> The
Oxford Dictionary of
Philosophy,
p. 126.





2 Orientation
=============

"When a great many people agree that a problem is insignificant, that
usually means it is not. Insignificance is the locus of true
significance." -- Roland Barthes, The Grain of the Voice, p. 177.

"The social, conformist world always bases its idea of nature on the
fact that things resemble each other, and the resulting idea of nature
is both artificial and repressive: the 'natural.' Common sense always
considers things that resemble each other 'natural.'" The essays in
Mythologies "present themselves as a denunciation of 'what goes without
saying.'" -- Roland Barthes, The Grain of the Voice, p. 208.





3 Constructing Reality through Conversation
===========================================

M. Heller (1988: 14): "Ethnomethodological approaches have focused on
the ways in which recurring patterns of language themselves provide a
contextual framework in which to situate the significance of variable
verbal behavior. These approaches have as their goal precisely the
understanding of the significance of behavior from 'the members' point
of view', and take the position that patterns of language use are
strategies for the social construction of reality. ... The central
question remains of the way in which codeswitching enables speakers to
define both conversational reality (organize information, highlight new
or important information, etc.) and social reality (to define one's
social role through the definition of one's conversational role, and
through situating oneself with respect to the conversational resources
currently available, that is, by accepting or rejecting the sets of
language choice conventions that are available."
