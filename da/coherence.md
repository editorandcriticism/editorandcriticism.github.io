title: Coherence and Cohesion in Text Linguistics
---

1 Introduction
==================



*Cohension* and *coherence* are terms used in [discourse
analysis](defs/d_da.html) and [text
linguistics](what-is-text-linguistics.html) to describe the properties of
written texts.



2 Cohesion
==============



In <img src="/images/0521446880.gif" align="right" /> Contrastive
Rhetoric: Cross-Cultural Aspects of Second-Language
Writing,
Ulla Connor defines cohesion as "the use of explicit linguistic devices
to signal relations between sentences and parts of texts." These
cohesive devices are phases or words that help the reader associate
previous statements with subsequent ones. In

in
English,
M.A. Halliday and Ruqaiya Hasan identify five general categories of
cohesive devices that signal coherence in texts:

1.  reference
2.  ellipsis
3.  substitution
4.  lexical cohesion
5.  conjunction





A text may be cohesive without necessarily being coherent: Cohesion does
not spawn coherence. "Cohesion," Connor writes, "is determined by
lexically and grammatically overt intersentential relationships, whereas
coherence is based on semantic relationships."




3 Coherence
===============



Coherent texts make sense to the reader. In Text
and Context: Explorations in the Semantics and Pragmatics of
Discourse,
Teun A. van Dijk (p. 93) argues convincingly that coherence is a
semantic property of discourse formed through the interpretation of each
individual sentence relative to the interpretation of other sentences,
with "interpretation" implying interaction between the text and the
reader. One method for evaluating a text's coherence is [topical
structure analysis](tsa-method.html).

Editorials](topical-structure-analysis-of-editorials.html)** This paper analyzes the topical structure of accomplished essays and
compares it with the topical structure tacitly preferred by assessors in
their judgments of student essays. The central aim is to examine whether
the same patterns of topical structure that are rewarded by assessors in
student writing, as reported by previous studies, are in fact being used
by professionals writing within a similar genre. The results of the
comparison will help determine the extent to which essays written for
such tests as Educational Testing Service's TOEFL Test of Written
English, analyzed by Schneider and Connor (1991), are being evaluated in
accordance with the unstated norms of topical structure in comparable
accomplished prose. [Read more ...](topical-structure-analysis-of-editorials.html)
