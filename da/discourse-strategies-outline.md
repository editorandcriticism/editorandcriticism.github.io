1 Preface
=========

**Note:**All quoted passages and page numbers are from John J. Gumperz,
*Discourse Strategies* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1982)
unless otherwise noted.

"This book seeks to develop interpretive sociolinguistic approaches to
the analysis of real time processes in face to face encounters." p. vii.

"Detailed observation of verbal strategies revealed that an individual's
choice of speech style has symbolic value and interpretive consequences
that cannot be explained simply by correlating the incidence of
linguistic variants with independently determined social and contextual
categories." p. vii.

"Sociolinguistic variables are themselves constitutive of social reality
ad can be treated as part of a more general class of indexical signs
which guide and channel the interpretation of intent." p. vii.





2 Introduction (Ch. 1)
======================

"Only when a move has elicited a response can we say communication is
taking place." p. 1.

"Conversationalists thus rely on indirect inferences which build on
background assumptions about context, interactive goals and
interpersonal relations to derive frames in terms of which they can
interpret what is going on." p. 2.

"Understanding presupposes conversational involvement. A general theory
of discourse strategies must therefore begin by specifying the
linguistic and socio-cultural knowledge that needs to be shared if
conversational involvement is to be maintained, and then go on to deal
with what it is about the nature of conversational inference that makes
for cultural, subcultural and situational specificity of
interpretation." p. 2-3.

Two "dialogic properties" of exchanges:

1.  "interpretations are jointly negotiated" ... "and judgements either
    confirmed or changed by the reactions they evoke."
2.  "conversations in themselves often contain internal evidence of what
    the outcome is, i.e. of whether or not participants share
    interpretive conventions or succeed in achieving their communicative
    ends." p. 5.

"Language differences play an important, positive role in signalling
information as well as in creating and maintaining the subtle boundaries
of power, status, role and occupational specialization that make up the
fabric of our social life." pp. 6-7.

"By careful examination of the signalling mechanisms that
conversationalists react to, one can isolate cues and symbolic
conventions through which distance is maintained or frames of
interpretation are created." p. 7.





3 The Sociolinguistics of Interpersonal Interaction (Ch. 2)
===========================================================

3.1 Structural Linguistics
--------------------------

An important discovery 19th-century scholarship was that grammatical
structure is the underlying dynamic of all verbal communication.

1.  Jacob Grimm and others had already demonstrated that "one cannot
    rely on comparison of words as meaningful wholes." One must analyze
    patterning the level of both form and content. p. 9.
2.  "It was not until scholars ceased to concentrate on articulatory
    facts as such and began to focus on contrastive relationships among
    acoustically similar sets of sound stimuli that valid
    generalizations became possible." p. 10.
3.  "The distinction based on empirical observations and abstractions
    based on contrasts at the level of sound and meaning is reflected in
    ... Saussure's classic dichotomy between parole or speech and langue
    or language." p. 10.
4.  The aim of the contrastive studies carried out in structural
    linguistics "is to eliminate redundancies and test for gaps in the
    data so as to derive a minimal set of relationally defined
    categories which, while not necessarily faithful to articulatory
    detail, nevertheless can, with the aid of linguistic realization
    rules, account for what is meaningful ... " p. 11.

"In its most general form, structuralist theory hold that human
cognition can be described in terms of abstract, relationally defined,
context free symbolic categories." p. 11. QV Barthes 1964 and
Levi-Strauss 1976.

"Only data which had been removed from situated contexts and transposed
into abstract categories through further intensive elicitation sifting
and hypothesis testing could serve as the basis for generalizations
about language functioning." p. 12.

3.2 Grammatical Systems
-----------------------

Benjamin
Lee Whorf's work on the relationship between the grammatical systems of
Native American languages and on the world view of their speakers led to
a view of meaning which is opposed to the then-current and still widely
held philosopher's view that human linguistic reasoning is describable
in terms of universal logical processes, which are independent of the
way in which propositions are expressed in particular languages and
cultures. Sapir sees meaning as both culture bound and subconsciously
patterned." p. 14.

"It seems clear than knowledge of grammatical rules is an essential
component of the interactive competence that speakers must have to
interact and cooperate with others. Thus if we can show that individuals
interacting through linguistic signs are effective in cooperating with
others in the conduct of their affairs, we have prima facie evidence for
the existence of shared grammatical structure. One need not as the
nineteenth-century normative grammarians did, and many modern educators
continue to do, attempt to judge an individual's basic linguistic
ability in reference to an a priori set of grammatical standards." p.
19.

"I believe that to understand the role of language in education and in
social processes in general, we need to begin with a closer
understanding of how linguistic signs interact with social knowledge in
discourse." (Gumperz 1982: 29).

3.3 Communicative Interactions
------------------------------

"There is a need for a sociolinguistic theory which accounts for the
communicative functions of linguistic variability and for its relation
to speakers' goals without reference to untestable functionalist
assumptions about conformity or nonconformance to closed systems of
norms."

1.  Since speaking is interacting, such a theory must draw its basic
    postulates from what we know about interaction. "It must account for
    the fact that being able to interact also implies some sharing." p.
    29.
2.  "Empirical methods must be found to determine the extent to which
    underlying knowledge is shared." p. 30.

"Interpretations of intent are of course unstable. ... A multiplicity of
interpretations is always possible ..." p. 32.





4 Conversational Code Switching (Ch. 4)
=======================================

**Definition:** "Conversational code switching can be defined as the
juxtaposition within the same speech exchange of passages of speech
belonging to two different grammatical systems of subsystems." p. 59. 2.

**Purpose:** "That code switching serves to convey semantically
significant information in verbal interaction has not been
systematically explored. The purpose of the present chapter is to focus
on these communicative aspects of code switching; to show how speakers
and listeners utilize subconsciously internalized social and grammatical
knowledge in interpreting bilingual conversations." pp. 63-64.

4.1 Some Social Uses of Conversational Code Switching
-----------------------------------------------------

"It is this overly marked separation between in- and out-group standards
which perhaps best characterizes the bilingual experience." p. 65.

"What distinguishes bilinguals from their monolingual neighbors is the
juxtaposition of cultural forms: the awareness that their own mode of
behavior is only one of several possible modes, that style of
communication affects the interpretation of what a speaker intends to
communicate and that there are others with different communicative
conventions and standards of evaluation that must not only be taken into
account but that can also be imitated or mimicked for special
communicative effect." p. 65.

1.  in-group = we;
2.  out-group = they.
