1 Approaches to Discourse
=========================

<img src="/images/0226904350.gif" align="right" /> *Culture
and Value*, a collection of Ludwig Wittgenstein's aphorisms, contains a
puzzling remark:

> "In a conversation: one person throws a ball; the other does not know
> whether he is supposed to throw it back, or throw it to a third
> person, or leave it on the ground, or pick it up and put it in his
> pocket, etc."1

The remark is puzzling because in the vast majority of cases that take
place under ordinary circumstances, it seems that any two people engaged
in a conversation have little trouble interpreting and responding
meaningfully to each other's utterances. Perhaps Wittgenstein intends
the remark to illustrate that when two interlocutors engage
in<img src="/images/bklwpi.gif" align="right" /> conversation, they are often forced to feel their way -- to try to
determine as best they can the kind of the game that is being played,
its rules and goals, its boundaries and players. Yet precisely how
interpretation and response are carried out in the game of conversation
remains a puzzle. The goal of discourse analysis, as broadly conceived,
is to unravel this mystery: To describe the game, to illuminate its
often obscure rules, to clearly mark out its boundaries and to identify
its players, coaches and referees.

Although discourse analysis has come to be seen as a subdiscipline of
linguistics, the roots of several of the seven established approaches to
<img src="/images/0631166238.gif" align="right" /> discourse have grown out of philosophy, and at least two of them are
based directly in the writings of prominent philosophers. The approach
known as speech act theory was formulated by the philosopher John L.
Austin and developed by John Searle. A second approach, often called
pragmatics, has its foundations in the writings of H.P. Grice. Both
approaches have been influenced, at least on the margins or in their
maturation, by Wittgenstein's later writings, especially *Philosophical
Investigations*. There are especially strong parallels between speech
act theory and Wittgenstein's emphasis on usage and language-games.^2^

This essay seeks to take Wittgenstein's influence on discourse analysis
a step further by using his writings as the theoretical foundation for
an approach to analyzing discourse that is distinct from speech act
theory,
<img src="/images/bkgenres.gif" align="right" /> 
<img src="/images/0816612285.gif" align="right" /> which stems from the analytic tradition in philosophy, and to suggest
that a Wittgenstein-inspired approach may actually be closer in spirit
and content to that of an unlikely candidate whose views, in contrast to
the analytic school, harbor a distinctly Continental flavor which has
come to influence critical theory: Mikhail Bakhtin.

The essay begins by attempting to outline in fairly broad strokes an
approach to discourse analysis based on Wittgenstein's philosophy of
language in *Philosophical Investigations*. The approach will appeal to
the following Wittgensteinian views and constructs:

-   a focus on ordinary language
-   meaning as use
-   the language-game and context
-   function
-   speech activities
-   the connection of language to life
-   the role of customs and rule-governed activities
-   the indeterminacy of meaning
-   an antipathy to reductionism
-   a focus on moves in a game

As I develop a Wittgenstein-driven approach to discourse, I will point
out in passing several ways in which it differs from a speech act
approach.

As the essay progresses, I will increasingly turn toward analyzing a
particular kind of discourse from a Wittgensteinian perspective:
psychoanalytic conversation. Even though I do not realize this ambition
here, it is my hope that, as an extension of Wittgenstein's views on the
interpretation of an utterance's meaning in a particular context, a
Wittgensteinian approach to discourse will provide the basis for
analyzing the rhetoric that surfaces in psychoanalyst-patient dialogue.
Toward this end, the essay will close by briefly testing the approach's
explanatory yield by applying it to an early psychoanalytic
conversation.





2 Points of Departure
=====================

Before beginning to outline a Wittgensteinian approach to discourse, it
may prove useful to clarify some general objectives of discourse
analysis, which coincide with at least two of Wittgenstein's
philosophical concerns in *Philosophical
Investigations*:
the concepts of meaning and understanding. Even though discourse
analysis and philosophy have common points of departure in their concern
with meaning and understanding, discourse analysis moves in a slightly
different direction as it begins to explore these concepts. Quite
broadly, it strives "to give an account of how forms of language are
used in communication."^3^ More specifically, it examines "how
addressers construct linguistic messages for addressees and how
addressees work on linguistic messages in order to interpret them."^4^
Discourse analysis, then, departs from the philosophy of language by
taking an orientation that "on the one hand includes the study of
linguistic forms and the regularities of their distribution and, on the
other hand, involves a consideration of the general principles of
interpretation by which people normally makes sense of what they hear
and read."^5^ In stark contrast to the theorizing of philosophy, the
investigation of these concerns often takes the form of empirical
analysis. Yet discourse analysis finds itself in need of appealing to
philosophy as well as its progenitor, linguistics, for its theoretical
framework. Hence the attempt of this essay to construct from
Wittgenstein's work the theoretical underpinnings of another approach to
discourse analysis.^6^





3 The Basis for a Wittgensteinian Approach
==========================================

Some aspects of Wittgenstein's thought as laid out in *Philosophical
Investigations* readily lend themselves to analyzing discourse. His
focus on ordinary language, rather than on such ideal or logical
languages, is, for instance, a rather obvious starting point for any
meaningful analysis of conversation or text. Such logic-based approaches
to studying meaning as Tarskian truth-conditional semantics, while they
have their place in postulations about how semantic meaning may be
represented in the mind or brain of a speaker, are of little help in
analyzing the meaning of utterances in actual conversation. The analysis
of meaning in the context of social discourse must be addressed not
through formal logic or the modeling of cognitive structures but through
attention to the influence of cultural and social factors on the use and
interpretation of language across contexts.

Wittgenstein's appeal to ordinary language leads him to abandon the
tendency to attribute the meaning of a word to the object it names,
offering instead a nonreductionist principle that forms the foundation
of a Wittgensteinian approach to analyzing conversation: "For a large
class of cases--though not for all--in which we employ the word
'meaning,'" he writes, "it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word
is its use in the language."^7^ Thus, a participant in a conversation
interprets a word's meaning in accord with its use. This principle is a
fine starting point, but as a theoretical construct it may be so broad
that its application to conversation may be limited, leaving some common
signs unaccounted for. For instance, it cannot account for the
inferences and implicatures that people commonly make in conversation.
Furthermore, appealing to the use of a word may capture its direct
meaning but leave untouched meanings that manifest themselves in the
tone or inflection with which the word is used. Wittgenstein is not
unaware of this objection. He quickly moves to delimit his definition of
meaning more sharply by asking how to explain the difference in meaning
between a report and a command that employ the same words. The answer:
"It is the part which uttering these words plays in the language-
game."^8^ With this remark Wittgenstein slightly restricts his earlier
remark on meanings while expanding it from the level of the word to that
of the utterance, producing a principle with greater utility for an
approach to conversation, where the emphasis must be more on the
interpretation of utterances than single words. Wittgenstein's remark
can be seen as accomplishing two moves crucial to extending his
philosophical perspective to the analysis of discourse: First, it
expands the focus of analysis from the use of words alone to their use
in an utterance; second, it connects use to not only the language in
general but the particular context in which it is being used at the time
of the utterance.

After introducing meaning as use and the notion of a language-game in
*Philosophical Investigations*, Wittgenstein quickly adds another angle
to the point of view he is developing: function. For Wittgenstein, the
function of language goes beyond the mere conveyance of thought. He
exhorts us to "make a radical break with the idea that language always
functions in one way, always serves the same purpose: to convey
thoughts."^9^ For Wittgenstein, language, including discourse in both
conversation and text, can serve a multiplicity of functions or
purposes. Language's function, in any given case, can be just as much to
do something as to convey a thought. In this way, Wittgenstein's notion
of function can, I believe, be distinguished from his notion of use. A
function of a word or sentence is tied up more with what it is used to
do, in contrast to its use, which is its meaning: A word is used to do
something; the use of a word or a sentence has a function: A word or
sentence is used to carry out a function.

A problem that arises by associating a word's function with what it is
used to do is how to differentiate Wittgenstein's notion of the function
of language from that of speech act theory, which also focuses on what
an utterance is used to do. The difference lies in the connection that
Wittgenstein makes between activity and the function of language -- both
of which, in his view, may take an infinite variety of forms. Further:
Activity and language are in turn closely connected to life, a relation
that seems to be missing in speech act theory.

3.1 Speech Acts and Activities
------------------------------

In accord with Wittgenstein's emphasis on the use and function of words,
a Wittgensteinian approach to discourse includes an acknowledgement that
words are used as much to do things as to make statements. That words
are used to do things is also the central tenet of John L. Austin's
speech act theory. In remarks made to a Harvard audience in 1955 and
later
published<img src="/images/bkaustin.gif" align="right" /> under the title *How to Do Things With Words*, Austin said: "The issuing
of an utterance is the performing of an action."^10^ Wittgenstein makes
a similar remark ten years earlier, in 1945: "Words are deeds,"^11^ he
writes in an aphorism without additional comment in *Culture and
Value*.

In contrast to Austin, however, for Wittgenstein there is no use
developing a taxonomy of speech acts, because there is an infinite
variety of them, a view that sets Wittgenstein's perspective apart from
Austin's. "But how many kinds of sentence are there?" Wittgenstein asks
rhetorically, picking a fight with the likes of Austin and all such
taxonomists of the utterance. "There are," Wittgenstein rejoins,

> "countless kinds: countless different kinds of use of what we call
> 'symbols', 'words', 'sentences'. And this multiplicity is not
> something fixed, given once for all; but new types of language, new
> language-games, as we may say, come into existence, and others become
> obsolete and get forgotten."12

Wittgenstein goes on to link this multiplicity with activity, and
activity in turn with a form of life: "Here the term 'language-game' is
meant to bring into prominence the fact that the speaking of language is
part of an activity, or of a form of life."^13^

By making these connections, Wittgenstein's position closely mirrors
Bakhtin's^14^, summed up in the following passage which illustrates the
similarity between Bakhtin's notion of speech genre and Wittgenstein's
language-game:

> "The wealth and diversity of speech genres are boundless because the
> various possibilities of human activity are inexhaustible, and because
> each sphere of activity contains an entire repertoire of speech genres
> that differentiate and grow as the particular sphere develops and
> becomes more complex."15

<img src="/images/0140445277.gif" align="right" />
<img src="/images/0140442529.jpg" align="right" /> 
<img src="/images/0140446583.gif" align="right" />  Bakhtin
derives his claim from an analysis of Dostoyevsky's work, which was also
a favorite of Wittgenstein's. Bakhtin stood in awe of the multiplicity
of voices and languages (metaphorically, within say, Russian), and it
was in the work of Dostoyevsky that Bakhtin found the ultimate
celebration of the multiplicity of languages, a multiplicity that he
believed did "a kind of justice to life itself."^16^

In his turn and from his own perspective, Wittgenstein exhorts us to
"review the multiplicity of language-games in the following examples,
and in others," after which he makes a list of such starkly different
language activities as those quoted in (i) and (ii) below:

~~~~ {.program}
(i) "giving orders" 
    "asking, thanking, cursing, greeting, praying" 

and 

(ii) "describing the appearance of an object" 
     "reporting an event"
~~~~

The activities in (i) and (ii) are seen by many of today's
semantic<img src="/images/0679734503.gif" align="right" /> theorists as being distinct: The meaning of expressions that fall under
set (i) is dependent in large part on what it is used to do; the meaning
of set (ii), on the other hand, is often formulated in reference to the
truth conditions of the expressions. But Wittgenstein makes no bones
about placing both kinds of utterances into the same broad category: The
uttering of sentences -- whether statements or performatives -- is "part
of an activity."

In this way Wittgenstein's view of language closely mirrors Austin's. By
the end of *How to Do Things with Words*, Austin has expanded his
argument beyond explicit performatives to include all kinds of
utterances, including statements, for "stating," he says, "is performing
an act."^17^ Austin sums up his argument with the following conclusion:
"The truth or falsity of a statement depends not merely on the meanings
of words but on what act you were performing in what circumstances."^18^
Recall, however, that Wittgenstein gets one up on Austin: Like M.
Bakhtin, Wittgenstein makes a connection between life and language:
Speaking is an activity, a form of life.

3.2 Word and Original Action
----------------------------

Considering that I am ultimately interesting in answering the question,
What takes place in psychoanalytic dialogue?, connecting language and
action may provide a particularly powerful framework for viewing
psychoanalytic discourse. As Jean Piaget puts it, "the psycho-analysts
have shown us how close in their opinion is the bond which originally
connected word and action, words being so packed with concrete
significance that the mere fact of uttering them, even without any
reference to action, could be looked upon as the factor in initiating
the action in question."^19^ In fact, as Piaget tells us, "the word,
[psychoanalysts] say, having originally formed part of the act, is able
to evoke all the concrete emotional contents of the act."^20^ Thus, the
connection Wittgenstein makes between language and action may prove
particularly valuable when a Wittgensteinian approach to discourse is
applied to psychotherapeutic conversation, because, as Bakhtin puts it,
dialogue "is not the threshold to action, it is the action itself."^21^

Piaget's citation of the bond that originally connected word and action
brings us to another aspect of Wittgenstein's perspective that may prove
useful when directed toward discourse: his heuristic of appealing to
primitive states. "It disperses the fog," Wittgenstein says, "to study
the phenomena of language in primitive kinds of application in which one
can command a clear view of the aim and functioning of the words."22
And, when I turn to an analysis of psychotherapuetic discourse later in
this essay, I will do just that: I will examine a historic pre- Freudian
exchange between psychiatrist and patient.

3.3 Culture and Convention
--------------------------

Another element of a Wittgensteinian discourse analysis is the
connection that Wittgenstein repeatedly makes in *Philosophical
Investigations* between language and culture, with societal conventions,
norms, and rules falling under the general rubric of culture: They are,
for Wittgenstein, customs. "To obey a rule, to make a report, to give an
order, to play a game of chess, are," he writes, "customs (uses,
institutions)."^23^

Wittgenstein is not, of course, the first or only language analyst to
make such connections with regard to discourse: That culture heavily
influences conversational styles in systematic ways is the central tenet
of the approach to discourse analysis known as the ethnography of
communication, which examines how culturally generated rules determine
the underlying structure of conversation. For these ethnographers,
"culture encompasses or embraces a totality of knowledge and practices,"
including speech acts.^24^ As such, the ethnography of communication
subsumes speech act theory. Perhaps, then, a Wittgensteinian approach to
communication that not only acknowledges the totality of cultural
knowledge and practices involved in discourse but also emphasizes that
language is itself a form of life becomes superior to both the
ethnography of communication and to speech act theory.

3.4 Cultural Rules
------------------

As the ethnographers of communication and other linguists have shown in
their studies, the use of rule-governed activities can often be
empirically tested and verified. An empirical analysis of the role of
rule-governed behavior in conversational interaction can stand near the
center of a Wittgensteinian approach; its empirical basis endows it with
a robust methodological power because hypotheses about conversation that
take place in one interaction can be verified by examining other
conversational interactions. The findings, that is, are reproducible. As
a result, William Labov points out, many linguists and sociologists
"have been focusing on the rule- governed character of conversation and
uncovering preliminary principles which suggest that this activity may
be as well formed as the production of sentences."^25^ Such comments as
Labov's, however, should not be taken as meaning that there is already a
systematic rule-governed approach to discourse, whether based on the
writings of Wittgenstein or anyone else.

On the other hand, Wittgenstein's rule-based approach to explaining
meaning has been criticized as too broad, as too encompassing, to be
useful. The danger of the rules-for-use approach to meaning, Janet D.
Fodor writes as she considers a Wittgensteinian approach to generative
semantics, is that "it might be too broad to be useful." Thus, she
continues, if the rules-for-use approach "is to serve as the basis for a
theory of meaning, the notion of a use must be constrained in some
way."^26^

However, Wittgenstein, his objectives broader than Fodor's, moves in the
opposite direction: He stops short of attributing all linguistic
behavior or meaning to rules, acknowledging that "it is not everywhere
circumscribed by rules."^27^ Rules do not necessarily limit or determine
the kind of language-games that are played, for cultural customs do not
encircle all aspects of behavior, whether linguistic or otherwise. In
fact, Wittgenstein indicates "that a person goes by a sign-post only in
so far as there exists a regular use of sign-posts, a custom."
Metaphorically:

> "We can easily imagine people amusing themselves in a field by playing
> with a ball so as to start various existing games, but playing many
> without finishing them and in between throwing the ball aimlessly into
> the air, chasing one another with the ball and bombarding one another
> for a joke a so on."28

Thus, for Wittgenstein, conversation is not everywhere bounded by
definite rules, by customs. This perspective begins to shed some light
on the quotation from Wittgenstein with which I began this paper,
repeated here for convenience:

> "In a conversation: one person throws a ball; the other does not know
> whether he is supposed to throw it back, or throw it to a third
> person, or leave it on the ground, or pick it up and put it in his
> pocket, etc."29

This remark no longer sounds odd in light of Wittgenstein's view that
rules do not circumscribe all that can happen in conversation. And thus
a focus on rule-governed linguistic usage or behavior does not account
for all aspects of conversational interaction -- nor should it.

3.5 The Indeterminacy of Meaning
--------------------------------

Furthermore, Wittgenstein's remark demonstrates that in conversation,
meaning may in fact be at times unrecoverable, both to the
conversational analyst and to the interlocutor. As such,
a Wittgensteinian
approach to discourse recognizes the ultimate indeterminacy of meaning,
a<img src="/images/bk_derri.gif" align="right" />  position
that bodes well with what very well may be a fact of language. With
respect to indeterminacy, some linguists, postmodern theorists, and
analytic philosophers, including Wittgenstein, seem to be in agreement.
Brown and Yule, both of whom are linguists, write that "the perception
and interpretation of each text is essentially subjective."^30^ The
postmodern theorists, meantime, hold that every decoding is another
encoding. Jacques Derrida, for example, maintains that the possibility
of interpretation and reinterpretation is endless, with meaning getting
any provisional significance only from speaker, hearer, or observer.
Bakhtin, too, says "the interpretation of symbolic structures is forced
into an infinity of symbolic contextual meanings and therefore it cannot
be scientific in the way precise sciences are scientific."^31^ Both
Bakhtin's and Derrida's views are surprisingly not unlike those of W. V.
O. Quine's in "The Indeterminacy of Translation," where Quine argued
that "the totality of subjects' behavior leaves it indeterminate whether
one translation of their sayings or another is correct."^32^
Wittgenstein pays homage to the indeterminacy of meaning as well: "Any
interpretation still hangs in the air along with what it interprets, and
cannot give it any support. Interpretations by themselves do not
determine meaning."^33^ Wittgenstein's appeal to the notion of use in a
context as establishing meaning can be seen as similar to Derrida's view
that meaning is established only provisionally by speaker or hearer.
That meaning may in fact be indeterminate will be seen later in the
essay when I attempt to analyze a conversation from a Wittgensteinian
perspective.

Wittgenstein's view that interpretations themselves do not determine
meaning points to another strength of his approach: Its antipathy to
reductionism, its resistance toward assimilation, its aversion toward
attempts to develop an all-embracing theory. A monolithic, unified
theory need not -- indeed cannot -- account for all aspects of
conversational meaning and understanding. And attempts should not be
made to treat conversation thusly, for meaning and understanding vary
greatly, as Wittgenstein suggests, from case to case, context to
context. Neither rule-governed use nor other forms of interpretation can
account for the infinite variety of things people do with language and
for the functions that utterances serve. No unified theory can account
for the variety of linguistic life. Any attempt to do so will be futile.

3.6 Conversational Moves
------------------------

Finally, the crowning metaphor in a Wittgensteinian approach to
discourse is the attention to the moves that speakers make in
conversation. A focus on moves in a game can be mined not only from
Wittgenstein's metaphor of the game in general and of chess in
particular, but also from such typical entreaties as to consider "the
part which uttering these words play in the language-game."^34^ In fact,
the notion of a move in a language- game becomes explicit when
Wittgenstein is ruminating in Section 22 over Frege's view that every assertion
contains an assumption, which Wittgenstein says rests on the possibility
of writing every statement as "it is asserted that such and such is the
case." Wittgenstein retorts: "But 'that such-and-such is the case' is
not a sentence in our language -- so far as it is not a move in the
language-game."^35^

<img src="/images/0385094027.gif" align="right" /> The
construct of a move closely mirrors the notion of footing that Erving
Goffman employs in his interactional sociolinguistics approach to
conversation: Footing, Goffman says, concerns "the alignments we take up
to ourselves and the others present as expressed in the way we manage
the production and reception of an utterance."^36^ Goffman's focus on
alignments is quite similar to Wittgenstein's notion of communication as
moves in a game: "In terms of the chess analogy, communication is a
matter of the players' appropriate responses to each other's moves in
accordance with the rules of the game," Roy Harris writes of
Wittgenstein's language-game metaphor in *Language, Saussure and
Wittgenstein: How to Play Games with Words*.^37^





4 Psychoanalytic Discourse
==========================

As a test of the explanatory yield of a Wittgensteinian approach to
discourse, I will now turn to a brief analysis of a historically
significant psychoanalytic conversation. Using the approach outlined
above, I hope to shed some light on what takes place in the
psychoanalytic conversation excepted below from Fyodor Dostoyevsky's
*The
Double*.
The exchange is between the novel's hero, Titular Councillor Yakov
Petrovich Golyadkin, and his physician, Doctor Christian Ivanovich
Rutenspitz. In keeping with Wittgenstein's emphasis on the primitive
case, I have chosen to analyze this passage as an example of early,
pre-Freudian psychoanalytic dialogue because, I believe, it cuts to the
core of what I see as characteristic psychoanalytic dialogue: The
therapist suggests ways in which the patient can adapt to social and
cultural norms, while the patient resists such suggestions, which he
perhaps sees as admonitions. I also believe I am justified in using an
example of what is ostensibly fiction because the exchange is something
that could have taken place. Before beginning the analysis, I would like
to summarize a few aspects of the forthcoming conversation that should
be accounted for in the Wittgensteinian analysis.

1. What is the Golyadkin's aim in seeking to speak with Christian
Ivanovich?

2. What actions are being played out in the course of the conversation?

3. What are the boundaries of the dialogue, and how do they influence
the conversation?

4. How can the multiplicity of voices that surface in the dialogue be
accounted for?

5. What is the meaning, in particular, of Golyadkin's final quoted
utterance as well as Ivanovich's final response to it?

6. How, from a Wittgensteinian perspective, can the subtle changes in
the orientation or positioning of the speaker to the other, as often
marked by ellipsis and changes in linguistic form, be accounted for?

Now, come what may, I will attempt to analyze the passage paragraph by
paragraph. In the course of the analysis, I may at times have to stretch
the constructs I've taken from Wittgenstein in order to make them
applicable to analyzing conversation. Throughout the analysis I will
interject commentary on the status and use of the constructs. Recall,
however, that as Wittgenstein himself acknowledges, interpretations
cannot bestow meaning. As such, the analysis below is only one possible
interpretation of the passage. It's actual meaning, if it can be said to
have one, may be indeterminable.

4.1 The Language-Game
---------------------

> "I've come to trouble you for a second time, Christian Ivanovich,"
> began Mr. Golyadkin with a smile, "and to crave your indulgence once
> again...." Mr. Golyadkin was plainly at a loss for words.

Golyadkin's use of the words "trouble" and "crave your indulgence"
suggests that a particular language-game is being played: Golyadkin is,
it seems, coming to trouble the doctor with his problems; Golyadkin
wants the doctor to listen to him. Indicating this aim seems to be the
function of his utterances.

By using the utterances "come to trouble you" and "crave your
indulgence," Golyadkin also seems to be acknowledging his subordinate
position in the game; as such, the use of these two utterances is linked
closely to the social status of each participant, with it perhaps being
customary to address doctors with deference. To summarize, the meaning
of these utterances, in addition to the straightforward meaning
generated by the use of their composite words, is the expression of
deference, whereas their function is the indication of Golyadkin's
purpose.

But next, Golyadkin, having begun his spiel, abruptly halts and finds
himself at a loss for words. Perhaps he does not want the doctor to
listen to him after all. The shift from seeking a listener for his words
to having no words to say at all takes place at Dostoyevsky's insertion
of the ellipses.

This appraisal of the first paragraph establishes two categories of
constructs: the notion of the language-game is a macro-level analytical
tool, whereas meaning as use, whether applied to words or utterances, is
a micro-level construct.

4.2 Language-Game Revised
-------------------------

> "H'm ... yes!" said Christian Ivanovich weightily, letting the smoke
> escape from his lips and laying his cigar on the table, "but you must
> follow my instructions; I explained to you, you know, that the
> treatment must consist in changing your habits.... Well, relaxation,
> something to take you out of yourself; well, for instance, visiting
> friends and acquaintances, and at the same time not being afraid to
> take a drink; and, likewise, keeping to cheerful company."

Before Golyadkin has even begun to disclose what's troubling him,
Christian Ivanovich, taking up the role of authority that Golyadkin has
bestowed upon him, admonishes Golyadkin "to follow my instructions." The
language-game has shifted. It is now an authority figure giving some
rather stern counsel to a listener, and no longer a speaker seeking a
sympathetic listener. But again, at the ellipsis, a change in the voice
occurs: After the ellipsis Christian Ivanovich's advice loses its stern,
monologic style and is supplanted by a more congenial, more suggestive <img src="/images/bkblackb.gif" align="right" /><img src="/images/bkmonk.gif" align="right" /> 
dialogic voice -- a voice that more intimately addresses Golyadkin, a
voice that seems to sense that Golyadkin needs sympathy, or at least a
softer tone. How can a Wittgensteinian approach to discourse account for
this subtle shift in voice? Seeing both segments as speech acts seems to
be of little help: Both before and after the ellipsis, the doctor is
engaging in the same general linguistic action: giving advice. Likewise,
the language-game seems to shift little, if at all, in the segments
before and after the ellipsis. Perhaps a customary rule dictates that an
interlocutor shall soften the delivery of his admonitions after the
first volleys have been fired. This possibility, however, does not
account for my intuition that Christian Ivanovich is beginning to sense
the need for sympathy in the other and to address him accordingly. Thus,
perhaps Christian Ivanovich is making a subtle conversational move with
the other in mind; that is, he is shifting his alignment with regard to
the other.

Since the next segment of the exchange is paraphrased by Dostoyevsky, I
will reproduce it for the sake of continuity and context but will not
comment on it beyond saying that Golyadkin's tireless retorts that he is
"like everybody else" reveals his resistance to the proposed treatment
and to change as well as to the doctor's belief that he needs to
socialize more. Had they been written as dialogue instead of
paraphrased, Golyadkin's replies could have been accounted for from a
Wittgensteinian perspective as speech activities or conversational
moves, both of which are micro-level constructs.

> Mr. Golyadkin, still smiling, lost no time in remarking that it seemed
> to him he was like everybody else, that he had his own flat, he had
> his amusements like anybody else ... that he could, of course, go to
> the theatre, for he had means, like anybody else, that he was working
> during the day, but spent his evenings at home, and that it was
> absolutely all the same to him; he even stated in passing that as far
> as he was aware he was no worse than other people, he lived at home in
> his own flat and, to conclude, he had Petrushka. Here Mr. Golyadkin
> paused.

4.3 The Shift Continues
-----------------------

> "H'm, no, that kind of arrangement is not what I meant, and not at all
> what I should like to ask you about. I am interested to learn whether
> in general you are fond of convivial company and like having a good
> time.... Well, are you now leading a melancholy or a cheerful kind of
> life?"

Again a shift occurs at the ellipsis: Before it, the doctor speaks
monologically, addressing Golyadkin only indirectly. It is only after
the ellipsis that the doctor begins to address Golyadkin directly. The
notion of a move in a language-game, in response to what the other says
or does, can account, at least broadly, for this shift. One problem,
however, is that such an account provides only a macro-level
interpretation of the shift. The reason for the move remains unclear.

4.4 Boundaries and Realignment
------------------------------

> "Well, Christian Ivanovich, I..."

> "H'm....I was saying," the doctor interrupted, "that you require a
> radical transformation of your whole life and, in a certain sense, a
> change in your character." (Christian Ivanovich strongly emphasized
> the word "change" and paused for a moment with a very significant
> air.) "Don't shun the pleasures of life; go to the theatre and the
> club, and whatever you do, don't be afraid of taking a drink. It's not
> good to stay at home all the time ... you simply must not sit at
> home."

Here, Christian Ivanovich continues with his same line, trying to
persuade Golyadkin that he needs to change and open himself up to the
pleasures of social activity. And Golyadkin, responding, continues to
resist Christian Ivanovich's counsel by expressing his independence.
Even though he had said in his previous remarks that he was like
everybody else, here he rather vehemently insists that he is "a man
apart," that he has no need for anybody else -- at least until his final
utterance of the paragraph.

> "I like quiet, Christian Ivanovich," said Mr Golyadkin, casting a
> significant glance at the doctor, and obviously searching for the
> words that would most successfully express his meaning, "and in my
> flat there's only me and Petrushka. ... I mean my man-servant,
> Christian Ivanovich. I mean, I go my own way, Christian Ivanovich, my
> own particular way, Christian Ivanovich. I am a man apart, and as far
> as I can see, I don't depend on anybody. I want to go out, too,
> Christian Ivanovich."

> "What? ... Oh, yes! Well, there's no pleasure in going out nowadays;
> the weather's very bad."38

In the last line uttered by Golyadkin, he abruptly acquiesces to
Christian Ivanovich's exhortations. Golyadkin's concession that "I want
to go out, too" comes in the wake of so many full- fledged statements to
the contrary that Christian Ivanovich misunderstands him, and himself
finally concedes in his turn to Golyadkin's previous remarks that
quietly staying at home is more pleasurable than going out. The dialogue
seems to converge onto these two concessions, with each interlocutor
capitulating to the other in his turn. How can we make sense of this
with a Wittgensteinian approach to conversational analysis?

This odd turn of events can be accounted for quite generally by arguing
that both the doctor and Golyadkin are making a move -- concession -- at
the same time. They are realigning their utterances to those of the
other, a realignment that may be necessitated on both of their parts by
certain cultural conventions that are at play. For instance, one such
convention may be to not continue for too long any conflict that arises <img src="/images/bkslprag.gif" align="right" /> 
in a conversation in a particular language game, such as between doctor
and patient. Or, to put it another way, the degree of sustainable
conflict may be establishing a boundary for this conversation. With both
Golyadkin and Ivanovich bumping up against the boundary, neither is
certain what rules, if any, dictate the appropriate response. But
without knowing more about the conversation rules and social mores of
the times, this explanation cannot be confirmed. As it stands, then, the
motivation for their mutual realignment is indeterminate. And, as we
have seen above, the fact that a Wittgensteinian approach to
conversation can leave meaning indeterminate can be seen in cases like
this one as a strength.





5 Strengths and Limitations of the Approach
===========================================

Although Wittgenstein's metaphor of conversation as ball game is a
particularly useful lens through which to view conversation, there are,
as my analysis of the excerpt from *The Double* illustrates, several
weaknesses of an approach that uses Wittgenstein's philosophy as the
basis for an analysis of discourse. Many of the shortcomings stem from
the macro-level analysis that the approach generates: The approach's
orientation may be too wide to be used successfully in a line-by-line
analysis of a conversation. When applied to actual conversation, the
notion of a move in a language-game, for instance, is so broad as to be
nearly useless: It can account for just about anything done in
conversation but only in quite general terms. Without knowing precisely
what the rules of conversation are before conducting the analysis, we
find ourselves left in the position of ascribing a move to an unknown or
as yet undetermined rule. On the other hand, the analysis of a move may
help unearth a rule or custom.

The connection that Wittgenstein makes between linguistic activities and
language as a form of life is likewise problematic. It is unclear how
such a broad declaration, while interesting in theory, can be applied in
any specific way to analyzing conversation. With regard to
psychoanalytic discourse, however, the connection does have a certain
utility: A person's way of life and governing perspective are embedded
in his or her manner of speaking. Thus, to shift that way of speaking
significantly can be seen as a way to alter his perspective -- and his
life.

Another aspect of conversation that seems difficult to account for
within a Wittgensteinian perspective is the dialogic nature of the
utterance -- the fact that any one utterance or any conversational turn
may be marked by a multiplicity of voices coming from a single speaker.
Furthermore, as the analysis of the passage from *The Double* attests,
it is similarly difficult to account for subtle differences in the way
that one speaker addresses another. In other words, it is difficult to
find a principled place in Wittgenstein's perspective for the roles
played by sympathy, empathy, and other emotional orientations to the
other that take place at the margins of much discourse, especially
psychoanalytic discourse. Indeed, it is difficult, given Wittgenstein's
view of language combined with his belief that everything is open to
view, to see how a Wittgensteinian approach to conversation can account
for times when a person has said "one thing, but seemed to imply
something quite different by the same words,"^39^ as
the<img src="/images/bkidiot.gif" align="right" /> 
narrator in *The Idiot* puts it. After all, as Bakhtin has pointed out,
utterances often have a double-edged nature. Accounting for this
dialogic nature of the word appears to be a difficulty for a
Wittgensteinian approach.





6 Conclusion
============

From Philosophical Investigations I have mined those aspects of
Wittgenstein's perspective toward language, meaning, and understanding
that lend themselves to analyzing conversational discourse. In doing so,
I have also revealed some of Wittgenstein's own ideas about meaning and
understanding in conversation and of how they differ from Austin's
theory of speech acts. I have also suggested that Wittgenstein's views
on language in general and utterance meaning in particular are closer to
the likes of M. Bakhtin than many in the analytical school typically
recognize. More importantly I have shown how a Wittgensteinian approach
to discourse can provide an account of what takes place in conversation.
But whether a Wittgensteinian form of discourse analysis can compete
with approaches like Dell Hyme's ethnography of communication or Gumperz
and Goffman's interactional sociolinguistics -- especially in analyzing
discourse, including psychotherapuetic conversation, on a microscopic
level -- remains in question.

<img src="/images/0631166238.gif" align="right" /> 
Throughout the essay, I will argue a hard line: the exact meaning of a
speaker's utterance in a contextualized exchange is often indeterminate.
Within the context of the analysis of the teacher-pupil exchange, I will
argue for the superiority of interactional linguistics over speech act
theory because it reduces the indeterminacy and yields a more principled
interpretation, especially when the interactional approach is
complemented by elements from other sociologically influenced methods,
namely the ethnography of communication and Labovian sociolinguistics.

My central thesis is that if, as Wittgenstein says, Freudian
psychoanalysis is based in myth, its application to actual psychological
problems does not, indeed cannot, resolve them. Instead, all it can do
is clarify them or present them in a different light. Implicit in my
argument is that this is how Wittgenstein thought of the results of
psychoanalysis, much like he thought of the application of his
philosophical technique to philosophical problems, especially those of
metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics. As such, Wittgenstein is also
subverting a larger myth: that the insights gained in psychoanalysis
lead to the scientific resolution of psychological problems.
