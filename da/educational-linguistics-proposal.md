1 Purpose of Course
=================================================


**T**o explore the structural and functional linguistic influences of a
learners\' spoken language on the acquisition of literacy, particularly
writing.







2 Goals
=========================


**T**o acquire a knowledge of the linguistic issues, problems, and
findings pertaining to the acquisition of writing as set forth in
representative papers and books from the linguistics literature.



To analyze the structural, functional, cultural, and discourse factors
that may affect the acquisition of writing and literacy in a first or
second language.

3 Description
=====================================


**T**his course will examine the linguistic factors that affect the
acquisition of literacy. We will look at the linguistic influences of
spoken language on written communication, making the acquisition of
writing our primary focus. The emphasis will be on the acquisition of
writing in the first language, but effects of literacy and illiteracy in
a first language on learning to write in a second language will also be
considered.



The problems encountered by speakers of nonstandard dialects in
producing standardized writing will be investigated. A central issue, at
least on the surface, is the conflict between the everyday use of a
nonstandard dialect and the societal requirements of using a highly
standardized form in written communication, including that of
educational institutions. Grammatical structures commonly used in spoken
communication, for instance, often violate prescriptive rules of written
communication. What problems do the morphology, syntax, semantics,
phonology, and narrative structure of disfavored dialects create in
learning to write in the standard dialect or prestige norm?



Other issues pertain to education. Why has there been a general failure
among teachers to pass their qualifying examinations in writing? What
are potential linguistic influences that have contributed to that
failure? If the acquisition of writing has been a problem for pupils,
can we identify potential linguistic causes of it? How can the insights
of linguistics contribute to enhancing the practice of teaching writing
to first- and second-language learners?



Can the findings of discourse analysis about the coherence and structure
of written texts beyond the level of the sentence contribute to the
teaching of writing? As Odlin (1989: 58) points out,



> Differences related to expectations about coherence in discourse may
> create special problems for learners in their reading or listening
> comprehension efforts. Alternatively, those differences may lead
> members of a speech community to consider the speech or writing of
> non-native speakers incoherent. It is not yet clear just how often
> such differences actually result in negative transfer. What is clear
> is the potential that cross-linguistic variations in discourse have
> for creating misunderstandings.



More specifically, how do differences in standards of logicality and
relevance among speech communities within the same language affect their
production and understanding of written communication.



These issues and others like them will be our point of departure.
