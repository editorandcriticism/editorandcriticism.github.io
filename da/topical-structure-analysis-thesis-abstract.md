This study analyzes the topical structure of accomplished essays and
compares the results with the topical structure tacitly preferred by
assessors in their judgments of student essays. The paper examines
whether the same patterns of topical structure that are rewarded by
assessors in student writing, as reported by previous studies, are in
fact used by professionals writing within a similar genre. The results
of the comparison help determine the extent to which essays written for
such tests as Educational Testing Service's *TOEFL Test of Written
English* are evaluated in accordance with the unstated norms of topical
structure in comparable accomplished English prose.

Variations in the topical structure of student essays have correlated
well with different assessments of writing quality (Schneider and Connor
1991; Witte 1983a, 1983b). Three variations of topical structure are at
issue: parallel progression, in which the same topic repeats itself in
successive sentences; sequential progression, in which the comment of
one sentence becomes the topic of the next; and extended parallel
progression, in which the first and last topics in a string of sentences
are the same but are interrupted with sequential progression. Schneider
and Connor (1991) found that highly rated essays contained a high
proportion of coherence-building sequential progressions and an extended
parallel progression that helps return the essay to its main theme.

The sample of accomplished essays analyzed in this paper are assumed to
represent the tacit norms of underlying topical structure within the
genre. The analysis finds that the accomplished essays contain similar
patterns of topical structure to the high-rated student essays in
Schneider and Connor's study (Schneider and Connor 1991). The
accomplished essays, like the high-rated student essays, contain a large
proportion of coherence-building sequential progression and a small
proportion of parallel progressions.
