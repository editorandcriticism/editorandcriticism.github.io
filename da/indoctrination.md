# Introduction: The Conflict Unfolds


**S**ince Rene Descartes conquered madness with reason to inaugurate the
modern era, psychology has brought forth a variety of treatments for
men, women and children gone mad, for those who lost their ability to reason
and let emotion run free, or for those with a mere ailing soul. And
since reason was established as sovereign, another history parallels the rise of asylums, Freudian psychoanalysis, lobotomies, electroshock
therapy, cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy, and psychopharmacology: The
history of resistance to psychology and to the oppression of madness in
the name of reason. <img src="/images/0140442065.gif" align="right" />

The assault on psychology begins with
Nietzsche in 1888, not long before Freud\'s founding of psychoanalysis near the
turn of the century. In the Forward to *[Twilight of the
Idols*,
Nietzsche writes that this book is \"an escapade into the idle hours of
a psychologist. \... This little book is a *grand declaration of
war*.\"1 And *Twilight* begins thus: \"Idleness is the beginning of all
psychology. What? could psychology be \-- a vice?\"2 <img src="/images/0140445145.gif" align="right" />

Norman O. Brown, with his call for Dionysian body consciousness in
*Life Against Death: The Psychoanalytic Meaning of
History*,
continues Nietzsche\'s offensive with a limited attack. Susan Sontag fires a
cannon for him: The trouble with current psychoanalytic theory and
practice is that it constitutes a form of conformity to the real world.
\"Psychoanalytic treatment,\" she writes, \"does not challenge society;
it returns us to the world, only a little better able to bear it, and
without hope.\"3 Sontag, pointing out that Brown rejects Freud\'s
assumption that \"the repressive agency of culture is necessary to
harness the self-repressive mechanism installed in human nature
itself,\"4 heralds Brown\'s inversion of Freud\'s thought as \"a project for the
transformation of human culture\" in which Freud\'s psychological
categories are correctly seen a political categories.5 <img src="/images/0819561444.gif" align="right" />

Deleuze and Guattari become the next generals in the offensive,
rejecting Brown\'s limited engagement for an outright war titled
*Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia*, which dialectically
opposes psychoanalysis on every front. \"Depression and Oedipus are
agencies of the State, agencies of paranoia, agencies of power,\" Mark
Seem writes in the Introduction to
*Anti-Oedipus.6*
What Deleuze and Guattari seek<img src="/images/0816612250.gif" align="right" />
\"to cure us of is the cure itself.\"7 Meantime, Michel Foucault, in
*Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of
Reason*,
questions reason\'s silencing of madness, documents the oppression of
the mad, and, the book\'s Introduction says, dispels the myth of mental
illness, returning madness and folly \"to their rightful place as
complex, human \-- too human \-- phenomena.\"

In contrast to Foucault and Deleuze and Guattari, others see the reverse
effect: Psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacological cures for, say,
depression or anxiety, are mandated by a socio-economic and cultural
system that, in fact, precipitates depression and other mental illnesses
by rewarding certain personality traits over others, as Peter D. Kramer
suggests in his popular <img src="/images/0140266712.gif" align="right" />
but philosophical book, *Listening to Prozac*.
Similarly, Kramer points out, the novelist Walker Percy sees anxiety as
an allergic reaction to a world gone awry. Either way, Kramer asks
poignantly: \"Does Prozac\'s ability to transform temperament foster a
certain sort of social conformity, one dominated in this case by
\`masculine\' capitalist values?\"8

Nietzsche, Brown, Sontag, Foucault. Deleuze and Guattari. Theirs is the
idea that psychoanalysis has been a vessel of cultural oppression, a
vessel for a complex but subtle form of reindoctrination into the
dominant social and economic system. And, as Foucault and Deleuze and
Guattari acknowledge, on the top shelf of the tools used in this system
of reindoctrination and oppression was the signifier \-- and the death
of dialogue. <img src="/images/0385267088.gif" align="right" />The telescope zooms in on language, on discourse, on its
broken syntax, and on silence:

> \"The man of madness communicates with society only by the
> intermediary of an equally abstract reason which is order, physical
> and moral constraint, the anonymous pressure of the group, the
> requirements of conformity. As for a
> common
> language, there is no such thing; or rather, there is no such thing
> any longer; the constitution of madness as a mental illness, at the
> end of the eighteenth century, affords the evidence of a broken
> dialogue, posits the separation as already effected, and thrusts into
> oblivion all those stammered, imperfect words without fixed syntax in
> which the exchange between madness and reason was made. The language
> of psychiatry, which is a monologue of reason *about* madness, has
> been established only on the basis of such a silence.\"9

<img src="/images/bkmfmad.gif" align="right" />
Sometimes the words of the madman are indeed not heard at all, or so it
seems from a few portrayals of unreason in literature. In \"Diary
of Madman,\" Nikolai Gogol\'s madman proclaims that \"they do not heed me, nor see
me, nor listen to me.\" The \"they\" to which Gogol\'s madman refers is,
of course, the other \-- all others, both the reason within himself,
including his internal interlocutor who challenges his madness, and
everyone external to him. In this way, Gogol\'s madman becomes much like
the Underground Man who lives on the brink of social exile and, indeed,
insanity in Dostoyevsky\'s *Notes from Underground*:
\"\`I\'m alone, and they are everyone else,\' thought the Underground
Man,\" Mikhail
Bakhtin
writes. The same division between the self and the other \-- indeed,
between madness and reason \-- later manifests itself in another of
Dostoyevsky\'s works,
*The Double*,
in<img src="/images/0816612285.gif" align="right" />
which the hero, Titular Councillor Yakov Petrovich Golyadkin, becomes so
divided between one of his internal selves and another that the latter
breaks off and becomes an external other known as Golyadkin Jr. After
the split, Golyadkin Sr. increasingly becomes a social exile seemingly
on the brink of insanity, a pariah without the confidence of the
Underground Man, while his split-off double becomes a self-assured
social success who operates, it seems, well within the confines of
reason.

A passage in *The* *Double* that takes place before Golyadkin\'s split
interests me in particular: It is the early conversation between an
anxious Golyadkin and his physician, Doctor Christian Ivanovich
Rutenspitz, who acts as Golyadkin\'s psychiatrist during the exchange.
As an early<img src="/images/0140442529.jpg" align="right" />
example of psychiatrist-patient discourse, the passage \-- because it so
brashly portrays the doctor as demanding that the patient change his
character and socialize more \-- raises several questions that relate to
the view that psychiatry and, by extension, psychoanalysis can induce
conformity or serve to indoctrinate its patients into the dominant
social fold. Why does Golyadkin feel compelled to visit the doctor? What
takes place, specifically, during their conversation and what does it
mean, both in the context of the rest of the novel and in relation to
life in general? Why did Dostoyevsky include it in the novel? Did he
mean it to be characteristic of psychological counseling? Or did he mean
it only as a foreshadow of Golyadkin\'s split? These questions, though I
do not attempt to answer all of them in this essay, are the inspiration
for my analysis of part of the Golyadkin-Ivanovich dialogue.

Â 

# Resistance and Indoctrination

**F**ollowing in the tradition of Brown, Deleuze, Foucault and others
and in relation to the passage from *The* *Double,* I am concerned with
how<img src="/images/bkidiot.gif" align="right" />
representatives of socially powerful institutions, whether they be from
the church of psychoanalysis or the halls of elementary schools, exhort
others to conform to the norms of the dominant culture. Conversations
between an interlocutor representing the institutionalized, dominant
culture and another interlocutor often contain at least two opposing
kinds of speech: exhortations to conform to the norm and resistance to
those suggestions \-- both between interlocutors and within the
individual who stands before the dominant institution. That individual,
as Dostoyevsky\'s writing reveals, is often split between feeling that
he should somehow be a part of the dominant culture and feeling that he
should, perhaps to preserve his own individuality, resist it. In
*The Idiot*, 
for instance, Prince Myshkin\'s

> \"uneasiness increased every minute. \... His feeling of dejection
> persisted; he longed to go away somewhere. \... He knew not where. A
> bird was singing in a tree above him and he began looking for it among
> the leaves; suddenly the bird took wing and flew away, and at the same
> moment he, for some reason, recalled the \`gnat\' in \`the hot
> sunshine\', about which Ippolit had written that \`it knew its place
> and took part in the general chorus\', but he alone was \`an
> outcast\'.\"10

Such feelings perhaps exist at one time or another in all of us. And
some psychoanalysts may, perhaps unwittingly, aim to bring the other
back into the societal fold when he is feeling outcast. The speech that
takes place between patient and psychoanalyst in such cases may be
marked by admonitions to conform and resistance to such indoctrination.
The same can be said with greater certainly of much teacher-pupil
dialogue: The teacher aims not so much to instruct the pupil as to lead
him or her to adopt culturally accepted patterns of behavior and spurn
those that are unacceptable.

# Central Claims

**W**ith such possibilities in mind and from the ideological perspective
outlined above, I will analyze the conversation that takes place in what
can be seen as an early example of psychiatrist-patient dialogue. My
central claim is that the conversation between Golyadkin and Ivanovich
can be interpreted as demonstrating the dichotomy between socialization
and resistance to it. I will also argue that in the dialogue Ivanovich
represents not only the external voice of socialization but also the
other voice within Golyadkin that urges him toward socialization, a
voice which finally surfaces in Golyadkin\'s remark that \"I want to go
out, too.\" Furthermore, Ivanovich represents not only the external
societal pressures to normalize but also the other in Golyadkin, who
eventually splits off from him to become the suave, highly social
Golyadkin junior.

To gain insight into the dialogic nature of
their<img src="/images/0679746048.gif" align="right" />
speech, I will examine the conversation from the perspective of Bakhtin,
using several of his observations about the writing of Dostoyevsky in
general and the character and voice of Golyadkin in particular as
starting points.

In my analysis I will also attempt to document the shifting voices in
the conversation by using linguistic markers. I will also employ speech
act theory and content features to analyze the speech of Golyadkin and
Ivanovich.

The application of these approaches to discourse demonstrate the
dichotomy that exists in their conversation between the socializing
forces of the doctor (and the other within Golyadkin, Golyadkin junior)
and resistance to socialization. In this way, the dialogue can be seen
as an example of psychology\'s early tendency to treat madness through
socialization \-- to indoctrinate the other into the dominant social
fold.

# Methodology

**B**akhtin\'s views on the discourse in Dostoyevsky\'s writing provides
the starting point for examining the interaction between Golyadkin and
Ivanovich. But despite the power of the Bakhtinian approach, his views
necessarily complicate the analysis. Once Bakhtin\'s philosophy of
double-voiced discourse and dialogic interaction is assumed, a single
utterance can take on a multiplicity of voices, of meanings, and of
orientations to the other. An inquiry that does justice to all the
possible dialogic angles within the Golyadkin-Ivanovich passage is
beyond the scope of this essay. I will therefore keep to those readings
of the dialogue that appear to be directly associated with the concerns
I outlined above.

The analysis is further complicated by what may be Dostoyevsky\'s
intentional mixing of voices within an utterance, for Dostoyevsky was no
doubt acutely aware, long before Bakhtin made it explicit, of the
double-edged nature of the word: \"He was saying one thing, but seemed
to imply something quite different by the same words,\"11 the narrator
in *The* *Idiot* says while commenting on an utterance by one of the
book\'s characters, Ippolit. Such dialogic speech may have as its source
double thoughts, as Dostoyevsky himself seems to suggest: \"\`Two ideas
occurred to you at one and the same time,\'\" Prince Myshkin says to
Keller in *The* *Idiot,* and \"\`it is terribly difficult to fight
against these *double* thoughts.\"12 Such \"double thoughts\" color the
speech of Golyadkin; to point out all such possible thoughts on the part
of Golyadkin is likewise beyond the scope of this paper.

Adopting a Bakhtinian perspective also complicates my use of speech act
theory. If speech act theory is applied to utterances assumed to have a
dialogic character, then a single utterance can carry out *more* *than*
*one* speech act. An utterance could, for instance, be both a request
and a denial at the same time. In my analysis, I will focus on what
appears to be the central speech act being carried out by either
Golyadkin or Ivanovich, leaving secondary speech acts aside.

## The Indeterminacy of Meaning

**A**nother disclaimer: Whether the utterances of any conversation are
analyzed using speech acts, linguistic markers that lend themselves to
experimental verification by being reproducible, or any other means or
combination thereof, meaning may in fact be at times unrecoverable, both
to the conversational analyst and to the interlocutor. It is my belief
that meaning is indeed ultimately indeterminate, a position that
bodes<img src="/images/bk_by_da.gif" align="right" />
<img src="/images/bkblackb.gif" align="right" />
well with what very well be a fact of language. With respect to
indeterminacy, some linguists, postmodern theorists, and analytic
philosophers seem to be in agreement. Brown and
Yule,
both of whom are linguists, write that \"the perception and
interpretation of each text is essentially subjective.\"13 The
postmodern theorists, meantime, hold that every decoding is another
encoding. Jacques Derrida, for example, maintains that the possibility
of interpretation and reinterpretation is endless, with meaning getting
any provisional significance only from speaker, hearer, or observer:
Meaning is necessarily projection. Bakhtin, too, says \"the
interpretation of symbolic structures is forced into an infinity of
symbolic contextual meanings and therefore it cannot be scientific in
the way precise sciences are scientific.\"14 Both Bakhtin\'s
and<img src="/images/bkgenres.gif" align="right" />
Derrida\'s views are surprisingly not unlike those of W. V. O. Quine\'s
in \"The Indeterminacy of Translation,\" where Quine argued that \"the
totality of subjects\' behavior leaves it indeterminate whether one
translation of their sayings or another is correct.\"15 Wittgenstein
pays homage to the indeterminacy of meaning as well: \"Any
interpretation still hangs in the air along with what it interprets, and
cannot give it any support. Interpretations by themselves do not
determine meaning.\"16 My own interpretation of the passage, despite
having some empirical basis, also merely hangs in the air along with
what it interprets: It is a decoding that is merely another
encoding.<img src="/images/bklwpi.gif" align="right" />

## Linguistic Markers

**M**y analysis appeals to the use of several linguistic markers, some
of which are inspired by Bakhtin. The others have either been adapted
from the work of others or devised by me.

Pauses and hesitations, indicated in written dialogue by ellipses, mark
a change in the orientation of the speaker to the other. Pauses and
hesitations, then, will be analyzed as a toggle between outward and
inward speech: I represent them in the analysis as \[Â± outward\]. This
marker is inspired by Bakhtin, who writes: \"Where ellipses appear, the
anticipated responses of the others wedge themselves in.\"17 Although
Bakhtin was addressing a passage from *Poor* *Folk,* it pertains equally
to the Golyadkin-Ivanovich dialogue, in which each of them iterates
between two voices: \"one confident, even too confident, and the other
too timid.\"18

Likewise, the word *well,* which often appears after Ivanovich\'s pauses
and hesitations, usually indicates a mitigation of the directly
preceding remarks.

A third marker, which supports the orientation indicated by the
ellipses, is a switch in the <img src="/images/0816612285.gif" align="right" />
speaker from using the overt pronoun *you* to using the nonovert pronoun
known as PRO. (PRO occurs, for instance, as the subject of an
infinitival clause: \"It\'s not good PRO to stay home all the time.\")
The switch from the overt pronoun *you* to PRO is often accompanied by a
dropping of modal-verb combinations and the use of gerundized verbs,
with which PRO can also occur. Speech that is spoken to the other as
\"You must abandon the investigation\" is more direct and
confrontational than \"PRO abandoning the investigation would be wise.\"
The shift from *you* to PRO can also be seen in the change of verbal
inflections.

## Bakhtinian Style Markers

**S**everal stylistic markers, all of which are based on Bakhtin\'s
writings, also come into play in the analysis. Repetition or
long-windedness signals a strong stance against the other as well as
self-assurance \-- a self-assurance necessitated by a lack of
self-confidence. A marker of a strong stance against both the internal
other and the external other, repetition or long-windedness may signal
for Golyadkin the simulation of independence; that is, resistance to
socialization. For Ivanovich, repetition or long-windedness marks
domination, often manifested as admonishments for the other to change.

Throughout *The* *Double,* as Bakhtin points out, Golyadkin\'s
repetitions often take the form of self-comforting speech in which he
repeatedly tells himself that \"he\'s his own man\" and, seemingly in
contradiction, that \"he\'s like everybody else.\" Bakhtin writes that
\"Golyadkin\'s speech seeks, above all, to simulate total independence
from the other\'s words,\" leading to endless repetitions that are
\"directed not outward, not toward another, but toward Golyadkin\'s own
self: he persuades himself, reassures and comforts himself, plays the
role of another person vis-a-vis himself.\"19 Meantime, however, Bakhtin
notes another orientation toward the other\'s voice: \"the desire to
hide from it, to avoid attracting attention to himself, to bury himself
in the crowd, to go unnoticed.\"20 The simulation of independence and
the avoidance of attention, as indicated by the repetition of
Golyadkin\'s discourse and content of his utterances, describes two of
Golyadkin\'s orientations, Bakhtin says. Accordingly, the simulation of
independence can be seen as an act of resistance to society, while the
avoidance of attention can be seen as hopes of assimilating to it. Both
of these tendencies manifest themselves poignantly in the dialogue
between Golyadkin and Ivanovich.

In contrast to repetition and long-windedness, a loss of words marks a
mitigating, retreating, or receiving position in relation to the other.
Reception can in turn give way to concession or submission, which forms,
Bakhtin says, the third noteworthy orientation of Golyadkin. In the
dialogue between Golyadkin and Ivanovich, submission forms a bridge
between the simulation of independence and the desire for social
assimilation: It is through capitulating to the socially dependent other
within himself that Golyadkin\'s desire to socialize rises to the
surface of conversation. However, concession or submission is, at least
in the passage in question, marked simply by the content of the speech.

## Speech Actions

**T**aking the notion of speech action as axiomatic, my analysis relies
heavily but in a rather peculiar way on speech act theory. I take my cue
from Labov and Fanshel, who have found that

> \"the crucial actions in establishing coherence of sequencing in
> conversation are not such speech acts as requests and assertions, but
> rather challenges, defense, and retreats, which have to do with the
> status of the participants, their rights and obligations, and their
> changing relationships in terms of social organization. We define
> *interaction* as action which affects (alters or maintains) the
> relations of the self and others in face-to-face communication. These
> relations move along several dimensions, which have been identified
> most usefully as *power* and *solidarity*.\"21

This view of speech acts lends itself well to analyzing the
Golyadkin-Ivanovich passage. In examining the coherence of their
dialogue, the position that the crucial speech actions are challenges,
defenses, and retreats bodes well with my abstracted version of what
Bakhtin considers to be the three dialogic orientations of Golyadkin as
well as my position that psychoanalytic dialogue can include challenges
to conform. Thus, in line with Labov and Fanshel, I will look at the
speech actions in the passage primarily in terms of challenges, defenses
and retreats. But I may also appeal to the following speech actions,
most of which are taken from the list presented by Labov and Fanshel on
Page 61 of their book: denial, agreement, retreat or mitigation,
intensification, assertion, question, request, and command.

Speech actions, as Labov and Fanshel point out, may also perform
metalinguistic operations, such as initiating, interrupting,
redirecting, responding, reinforcing, continuing, and repeating.22

## Intra-Action

**R**eturning for a moment to the remark by Labov and Fanshel excerpted
above, recall that they defined *interaction* as \"action which affects
(alters or maintains) the relations of the self and others in
face-to-face communication.\" In accord with the work of Bakhtin, there
is a related construct that also plays a role in face-to-face
communication: intra-action, which is the relation of the speaking self
to the other or others within the self. Such intra-action, as
Dostoyevsky has demonstrated, can have a profound affect on the voice of
a speaker, endowing an utterance with a multiplicity of voices, some of
which may be discordant. As Bakhtin puts it, such utterances can have
\"a word with a sideward glance.\"23 In other words, an individual\'s
utterance can simultaneously embody two or more positions. Thus,
utterances may be influenced not only by the interlocutor but also by
the internal other. In *The* *Double,* of course, the conflict between
an internal other within Golyadkin and his self becomes so intense that
the internal other eventually breaks off from the self to become an
external other.

## Features of Utterance Content

For the sake of convenience and contrast, the content of many of the
utterances in the passage can be reduced to the following features,
which complement the speech act analysis:

\[Â± social\] \[Â± independence\]\
\[Â± dominance\] \[Â± submission\]\
\[Â± admonition\] \[Â± resistance\].\
\[Â± confrontation\] \[Â± avoidance\]\
\[Â± permission\]

These content markers will be used as an aid in delineating the
dichotomy that I am positing between Golyadkin and Ivanovich.

# Analysis 

## The Golyadkin Dichotomy

**A**mong my claims is that the voice of Golyadkin\'s selves can be
heard in the speech of both him and Ivanovich. Their conversation
foreshadows Golyadkin\'s split into the anxious, socially dysfunctional
Golyadkin and the well-poised, socially successful Golyadkin Jr. In the
passage, Golyadkin primarily represents the voice of Golyadkin Sr.
(henceforth simply Golyadkin), while Ivanovich\'s speech represents the
partially objectified voice of Golyadkin Jr. \-- objectified because it
is, at least in comparison to the discourse of Golyadkin, authoritative
and monologic. Ivanovich, in contrast to Golyadkin, projects a
relatively nonhybridized, fixed voice. Ivanovich, then, represents an
early objectified version of Golyadkin\'s well-socialized double. As
will become apparent during the micro-analysis below, his speech
contains a \"predominance of <img src="/images/0140445277.gif" align="right" />
socio-typical determining factors.\"24 Golyadkin\'s speech, on the other
hand, is polyphonic, containing the traits of what Bakhtin calls active
discourse: It has, for instance, \"hidden internal polemics\" and
\"polemically colored autobiography and confession.\"25 It is
\"discourse with a sideways glance at someone else\'s word.26\" In the
Ivanovich-Golyadkin passage, Golyadkin\'s sideways glance is directed
toward the reflection of his own alter-ego, which takes the form of
Ivanovich. In speaking with Ivanovich, Golyadkin begins a dialogue with
his other self.

## Divergence and Convergence

These general characteristics of Golyadkin\'s and Ivanovich\'s speech
\-- one polyphonic, internally polemical, double-edged, the other
relatively monologic, authoritative, fixed \-- illustrate their
dispositions. Golyadkin prides himself at once on his independence and
on his being like everyone else. He resists socialization but craves it.
Meantime, Ivanovich, with his \"ribbon of an important Order,\"27 seems
to be a model of assimilation, of success within the dominant social
order.

Indeed, Golyadkin and Ivanovich are opposites. But since Ivanovich is a
reflection of the other within Golyadkin, there is a bit of the one in
each of the others, a relationship that gives rise to levels of
divergence in their speech \-- along with the possibility of
convergence. Their degree of divergence stands in direct relation to
their degree of conflict: The greater the divergence, the more intense
the conflict.

The degree of divergence between the two in the passage can be placed
into three categories: extreme, moderate, and slight. For Golyadkin,
extreme divergence from Ivanovich comes in
the<img src="/images/0140446583.gif" align="right" />
form of firm resistance to his dominance as represented by admonitions
to socialize. Moderate divergence takes the form of avoidance of
confrontation or attention. Slight divergence, indifference. Convergence
with the other would come in the form of submission. These forms of
Golyadkin\'s divergence, as well as those for Ivanovich, coincide with
some of the central features I have used to mark the content of the
utterances.

The degree of Ivanovich\'s divergence from Golyadkin takes roughly
opposite forms: slight divergence, a questioning, allowing, or receptive
posture; moderate divergence, confrontation; and extreme divergence, a
posture of domination marked by Ivanovich\'s strongest words toward
Golyadkin. Those words, as I will now turn to demonstrating, are
primarily admonitions to socialize.

## Micro-Analysis

**T**his section presents a step-by-step analysis of the part of the
Golyadkin-Ivanovich passage that begins on Page 133 and continues
through Page 135 of *The* *Double.28* Although I set the stage with a
brief analysis of each participant\'s posture as the interaction gets
under way, I quickly turn toward their verbal interaction.

**(1)\
GOLYADKIN,** just before entering the doctor\'s office:\
**Â§Act:** Approach and initiation.\
**Â§Posture:** \`tried to give his countenance a suitably detached air
\... and entered\'29\
**Â§Content** **Features** **of** **Posture:** \[+resistance\].\
**Â§Degree** **of** **Divergence:** At once extreme and slight.\
**Â§Notes:** Golyadkin seems to at once begin resisting the doctor by
trying to appear detached, an action that signifies withdrawal from
interaction, yet nonetheless enters the office and proceeds to interact
with the doctor.\
**IVANOVICH,** upon being interrupted by Golyadkin\'s entrance:\
**Â§Act:** Response.\
**Â§Posture:** \`involuntarily revealed an almost displeased
expression\'\
**Â§Content** **Features** **of** **Posture:** possibly
\[+confrontation\].\
**Â§Degree** **of** **Divergence:** moderate.\
**Â§Notes:** Contrast the way in which Golyadkin Jr. often sneers at the
appearance of Golyadkin later in the book. Examples of this posture
abound: \"\`Well, sir?\' asked Mr Golyadkin junior, facing Mr Golyadkin
senior with some insolence\"30; \"Mr Golyadkin junior glanced ironically
at Mr Golyadkin senior, thus openly and impudently flouting him\"31.
Golyadkin junior\'s displeased glances upon seeing Golyadkin senior mix
with the former\'s mischievous, fraudulent smiles toward the latter.\
Â \
**(2) GOLYADKIN:\
Â§Act:** Initiation.\
**Â§Posture:** \`challenging stare\'\
**Â§Content Features of posture:** \[+independence\].\
**Â§Degree of Divergence:** Fairly extreme.\
**Â§Notes:** Golyadkin\'s \"challenging stare\" simulates independence,
implying that he is his own master.\
**IVANOVICH:\
Â§Act:** Response.\
**Â§Posture:** \`questioning, inspectorial look\'\
**Â§Content Features of posture:** \[+permission\].\
**Â§Degree of Divergence:** Slight.\
Â \
**(3)** **GOLYADKIN:\
(A)\
Â§Metalinguistic Act:** Initiate.\
**Â§Speech:** \"I\'ve come to trouble you and crave your indulgence\"\
**Â§Speech Action:** Request (for a listener).\
**Â§Features of Utterance Content:** \[+submission\].\
**Â§Degree of Divergence:** Slight.<img src="/images/0375704051.gif" align="right" />**\
Â§Notes:** By using the utterances \"come to trouble you\" and \"crave
your indulgence,\" Golyadkin seems to be acknowledging his subordinate
position in relation to the doctor; or, to put it another way, he seems
to be saying that he is not his own master. The use of these two
utterances, however, may be closely linked to the social status of each
participant, with it perhaps being customary to address doctors with
some deference.\
**(B)\
Â§Metalinguistic Act:** Withdrawal.\
**Â§Speech:** \`loss for words\'\
**Â§Speech Action:** Retreat (from request for a listener).\
**Â§Features of Utterance Content:** \[+avoidance\].\
**Â§Degree of Divergence:** Moderate.\
**Â§Bakhtinian Style Markers:** A loss of words marks a mitigating or
retreating position in relation to the other.\
**Â§Notes:** The existence of the Bakhtinian style marker lends support
to the speech act interpretation.\
**IVANOVICH:\
Â§Metalinguistic Act:** Response.\
**Â§Speech:** \"but you must follow my instructions\"\
**Â§Speech Action:** Command.\

# Conclusion


**P**sychoanalysis claims for itself the terrain of the inner man, the
depths of consciousness, making itself into a modern religion that, like
most religions, aims to redeem the human soul. Nearly half a century
before Freud, Dostoyevsky<img src="/images/0393001423.gif" align="right" />
considered the main task of his realism to be the representation of
these depths of the human soul, Bakhtin says. Dostoyevsky believed these
depths were \"revealed only in an intense act of address.\" On an
interpretation of Dostoyevsky profoundly related to psychoanalysis,
Bakhtin writes:

> \"It is impossible to master the inner man, to see and understand him
> by making him into an object of indifferent neutral analysis; it is
> also impossible to master him by merging with him, by empathizing with
> him. No, one can approach him and reveal him \-- or more precisely,
> force him to reveal himself \-- only by addressing him dialogically.
> And to portray the inner man, as Dostoevsky understood it, was
> possible only by portraying his communion with another. Only in
> communion, in the interaction of one person with another, can the
> \`man in man\' be revealed, for others as well as for oneself.\"32

Was communion what Golyadkin was seeking by coming to Ivanovich for
another visit? Certainly, Golyadkin sought to commune with, first, Clara
Olsufyevna, and later, with his own double, Golyadkin Jr., after
initially encountering him in the street. Probably, he was seeking an
interaction that would reveal self within himself. If so, he found two
selves there: His own, and the reflection of his inner other in the
words of the doctor. In the least, though, Golyadkin was merely seeking
conversation with a doctor to help him cope with the problems he was
experiencing in trying to assimilate comfortably with the rest of
society.

But even by entering into the conversation of psychoanalysis, the
mechanisms of conformity, Sontag would say, may have already begun.
The<img src="/images/0385267088.gif" align="right" />
analysis of psychological discourse must be taken well beyond the
confines of psychoanalytic theory to actual exchanges between the modern
therapist and patient, to the words of the patient when spoken not in
the language of psychology, but in the language of madness. Golyadkin
senior embodies the language of madness while beginning to spurn
discourses of reason, just as the Underground Man did in his hidden
polemics against Descartes:

> \"And, to sum the whole thing up, why are you so *certain* that not
> flying in the face of his real, normal interests, certified by the
> deductions of reason and arithmetic, is really always for his good and
> must be a law for all mankind? After all, for the time being it is
> only your supposition. Even if we assume it as a rule of logic, it may
> not be a law for all mankind at all. Perhaps you think I\'m mad,
> gentlemen?\"33

Against the Underground Man\'s language of madness, and against the
comparatively primitive language of Golyadkin, must be measured the
responses of the psychiatrist, Foucault tells us.
As<img src="/images/0679734503.gif" align="right" />
I have shown in the passage from *The Double*, the responses of
Ivanovich, who I have shown mirrors the socially charged other within
Golyadkin, largely ignore Golyadkin\'s concerns, admonishing him instead
to engage in social activity. The psychiatrist seems not to hear
Golyadkin at all. Next Ivanovich mitigates his admonitions until he
finally comes into agreement with Golyadkin: a temporary convergence, a
merger. A compromise between reason and insanity.

But by the end of the story, after Golyadkin Jr. has split off from
himself and left Golyadkin Sr. teetering on the edge of social exile,
appearing to the rest of society as nothing short of mad, it is
Ivanovich, the psychiatrist, who Dostoyevsky chooses to remove Golyadkin
Sr. from a final social gathering and to lead him away to the asylum. In
the end, the psychiatrist \-- and perhaps the whole institution of
psychology \-- becomes Golyadkin\'s jailer.

## Walker Percy on Psychotherapy

<img src="/images/0312243324.gif" align="right" />From
Walker Percy\'s novel *The Thanatos Syndrome* (New York: Farrar Straus
Giroux, 1987).

\"**I** contrived that it crossed her mind that her terror might not be
altogether bad. What if it might be trying to tell her something, like
the mysterious visitor in her dream? I seldom give anxious patients
drugs. If you do, they may feel better for a while, but they\'ll never
find out what the terror is trying to tell them.\" (p. 6.)

\"**D**r. Jung was right in encouraging his patients to believe that
their anxeity and depression might be trying to tell them something of
value. They are not just symptoms. It helps enormously when a patient
can make friends with her terror, plumb the depths of her depression.\"
(p. 67.)

\"**S**ometimes I think that is the best thing we shrinks do, render the
unspeakable speakable.\" (p. 17.)

\"\... the posterior speech center, Wernicke\'s area, Brodmann 39 and
40, in the left brain of right-handed people. It is not only the major
speech center but, according to neurologists, the locus of
self-consciousness, the \`I,\' the utterer, the \`self\'.\" (p. 22.)

\"**C**ure? No. What\'s a cure in this day and age? Maybe a cure is
knowing there is no cure.\" (p. 76.)

\"**I**t looks as if real failure is unspeakable. TV has screwed up
millions of people with their little rounded-off stories. Because that
is not the way life is. Life is fits and starts, mostly fits. Life
doesn\'t have to stop with failure. Not only do you not have to jump in
the creek, you can even take pleasure in the general fecklessness of
life \... \" (p. 75.)

\"**I** discovered that it is not the sex that terrifies people. It is
that they are stuck with themselves. It is not knowing who they are or
what to do with themselves. They are frightened out of their wits that
they are not doing what, according to experts, books, films, TV, they
are supposed to be doing. *They*, the experts, know, don\'t they?\" (p.
88, ital in original.)

## The Myth of the Scientific Solution

In [The Myth of Psychoanalysis](/md/tech.html), the central
thesis is that if, as Wittgenstein says, Freudian
psychoanalysis<img src="/images/bklwaest.gif" align="right" />
is based in myth, its application to actual psychological problems does
not, indeed cannot, resolve them. Instead, all it can do is clarify them
or present them in a different light. Implicit in my argument is that
this is how Wittgenstein thought of the results of psychoanalysis, much
like he thought of the application of his philosophical technique to
philosophical problems, especially those of metaphysics, ethics, and
aesthetics. As such, Wittgenstein is also subverting a larger myth: that
the insights gained in psychoanalysis lead to the scientific resolution
of psychological problems. One of Wittgenstein\'s remarks about
psychoanalysis, made in 1938, explicitly confirms that he saw the
results of psychoanalysis not as a resolution of psychological problems,
but as merely a way of changing the way they are seen, thereby
dissolving them through clarification: \"In a way, having oneself
psychoanalyzed is like eating from the tree of knowledge. Knowledge
acquired sets us (new) ethical problems; but contributes nothing to
their solution.\"12
