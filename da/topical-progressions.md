### The Three Topical Progressions


The sequences of sentences, Witte (1983a: 319) writes, advance the
"discourse topic by developing a succession of sentence topics,
sequences that Lautamatti calls topical progressions," which help
describe how individual sentences cohere locally and how all sentences
within a text cohere globally. Connor (1996) shows that coherence can be
mapped using a system of three distinct progressions:

1.  **parallel progression**, in which topics of successive sentences
    are the same, producing a repetition of topic that reinforces the
    idea for the reader (\<a, b\>, \<a, c\>, \<a, d\>);
2.  **sequential progression**, in which topics of successive sentences
    are always different, as the comment of one sentence becomes, or is
    used to derive, the topic of the next (\<a, b\>, \<b, c\>, \<c,
    d\>); and
3.  **extended parallel progression**, in which the first and the last
    topics of a piece of text are the same but are interrupted with some
    sequential progression (\<a, b\>, \<b, c\>, \<a, d\>).

The relationship between the progression of sentence topics and the
semantic hierarchy of a text is captured in Lautamatti's notion of
topical depth. Lautamatti maintains that the sentence topic stated first
in an extended text is frequently at the highest level in the semantic
hierarchy. Lautamatti combines the concepts of topical progression and
topical depth to represent a text's topical structure in a topical
structure analysis.
