    This page outlines the three topical progressions used in topical
    structure analysis: parallel progession, sequential progression, and
    extended parallel progression.
title: How to Diagram Topical Progressions

#### Charting Sentential Topics and Discourse Topic 



Executing a topical structure analysis involves identifying topics and
relating them to previous sentential topics as well as the discourse
topic. Witte (1983a: 341 n. 50) identified topic by asking "what is this
sentence about?" and moving "from one noun phrase to the next until I
found what I thought was a satisfactory answer for each sentence in the
context of the whole discourse." Schneider and Connor's study also
identified topic by asking what the sentence is about. My analyses below
strive to use largely the same approach as that of Schneider and Connor,
enabling me to compare my findings with theirs.





The relations of sentential and discourse topics are charted using the
three kinds of topical progression detailed above. The first step in the
analysis is to identify and underline all the sentence topics in the
text. The second step is to construct a diagram corresponding to the
topical structure of the essay. The diagram, Connor and Farmer explain,
is constructed by placing sentence topics with parallel progression
exactly below each other. Sequential topics are indented progressively.
A topic with extended parallel progression is lined up under the
parallel topic to which it refers. When a chart is made to show the
topical structure of a text, the progressive indenting represents
topical depth. The following chart of a short newspaper editorial
illustrates this method for conducting a topical structure analysis:


``` {.program}
1 Federal Election Commission
2  both candidates [ref=Clinton and Dole]
3  both [ref=Clinton and Dole]
4   the party
5    ambiguity
6     explicit language
7      the Democratic ads 
8       Mr. Clinton
9 they [the federal election commissioners]
10       the laws
```





In this chart, the progressive indentation that sets Line 2 off from
Line 3 indicates a sequential progression. The vertical alignment of
Line 3 with Line 2 indicates that the topic in Line 3 is a parallel
progression. Meantime, the vertical alignment of Line 9 with Line 1
indicates an extended parallel progression. For convenience, in Lines 2
and 9 I have included the referents of the topics in brackets.

compares it with the topical structure tacitly preferred by assessors in
their judgments of student essays. The central aim is to examine whether
the same patterns of topical structure that are rewarded by assessors in
student writing, as reported by previous studies, are in fact being used
by professionals writing within a similar genre. The results of the
comparison will help determine the extent to which essays written for
such tests as Educational Testing Service's TOEFL Test of Written
English, analyzed by Schneider and Connor (1991), are being evaluated in
accordance with the unstated norms of topical structure in comparable
accomplished prose.
