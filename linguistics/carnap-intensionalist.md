title: 'Carnap\''s Intensionalist Approach'
---



1.  
    Carnap is concerned with how to deal with definitions. What is good
    for logical vocabulary, he says, must also be good for metalogical
    vocabulary.
    

2.  
    Carnap uses meaning postulates to adapt the format of logic to the
    analysis of natural language propositions, believing that
    philosophers should use the language of logic to address
    philosophical problems of ordinary language.
    

3.  
    Carnap\'s approach, then, can be seen as a formalization of Frege\'s
    approach to definition.
    

4.  
    Meaning postulates, for example, provide a format for stating and
    expressing relations between words. One question, however: How do
    you determine what to express in the meaning postulates?
    

5.  
    Carnap holds that the intensionalist view is correct, and thus must
    show that there is an empirical procedure that can be applied to
    show these intensional relations. Toward this end, Carnap puts forth
    a test, which is to ask the informant about the application of the
    words *horse* and *pferd*. Do they apply, Carnap asks, to all actual
    cases? Do they apply to possible cases?
    

6.  
    Meaning postulates should express generalizations about language
    based on speakers\' linguistic behavior in what they apply to actual
    and possible cases. A common language?

The argument from \"Two Dogmas\" supplies the \"missing\"
argument in the case for the inderminancy of translation. The argument
plays a role in the indeterminacy thesis because Quine\'s reason for
thinking that independent controls do not exist in translation takes its
force from the argument that there are no linguistically neutral
meanings. The absence of linguistically neutral meanings is a
prerequiste for the indeterminacy of translation.
