### Locutionary, Illocutionary, and Perlocutionary Acts




For Austin, three primary things are done in the issuing of an
utterance. Levinson (1983: 236) outlines them:





\(i) **Locutionary act:** the utterance of a sentence with determinate
sense and reference.





\(ii) **Illocutionary acts:** "the making of a statement, offer, promise,
etc., in uttering a sentence, by virtue of the conventional force
associated with it or with its explicit performative paraphrase"
(Levinson 1983: 236). The illocutionary act is what is directly achieved
by the conventional force associated with the issuance of a certain kind
of utterance in accord with a conventional procedure. Illocutionary
acts, in addition to covering such explicit performatives as promising,
also include statements. The illocutionary act carried out by an
utterance enables the saying of something to convey more than what it
literally said.





\(iii) **Perlocutionary act:** the bringing about of effects on the
audience by means of uttering the sentence, such effects being special
to the circumstances of utterance.





Austin thinks performative sentences do not have truth conditions
because they do not describe or report anything. In Austin's view,
uttering a performative sentence like "I promise to pay you back" is not
so much saying something as doing something. If nothing is said, it can
be neither true nor false.
