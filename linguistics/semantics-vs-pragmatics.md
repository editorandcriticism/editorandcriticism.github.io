### A Brief Survey of Principles and Definitions 



<i class="fa fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Question:** What principles or definitions have been offered in the
literature for distinguishing pragmatics from semantics?





**T**he question of how semantics relates to pragmatically oriented
theories is, Chierchia and McConnell-Ginet (1990) say, "wide open." For
them, semantics deals with those aspects of meaning that remain constant
whenever a given expression is uttered: Semantics covers what
expressions mean, while pragmatics covers what speakers mean in using
the expressions.





Along these lines, it is standard, Green (1989) says, to distinguish
between what a sentence means and what a speaker intends to convey by
the utterance of the sentence, and to restrict the role of semantics to
explicating the meaning of sentences in terms of conditions that must be
fulfilled for the sentence to be used to truthfully describe a
situation.





Thus: Aspects of the interpretation of utterances that do not involve
truth conditions are commonly considered outside the domain of
semantics, Green (1989) says. Whether an utterance is a promise, a
prediction, or a question and how metaphorical expressions are
understood are matters of pragmatics, not semantics.





More: Semantics is compositional: The meaning of a complex expression
relates in a predictable way to the meanings of the parts from which it
is constructed. The meaning of the whole is a function of the meaning of
the parts.





**P**ragmatics, on the other hand, is the study of situated uses of
language, Chierchia and McConnell-Ginet (1990) say, adding this caveat:
"Since direct experience with interpretation of language is experience
with interpreting uses, however, we cannot always be sure in advance
which phenomena will fall exclusively in the domain of semantics and
which will turn out to require attention to pragmatic factors as well,"
a fact that makes it difficult to free semantics from pragmatic
considerations. (Chierchia and McConnell-Ginet, 1990:5)





Pragmatics, Fasold (1990: 119) writes, "is the study of the use of
context to make inferences about meaning." Fasold asks whether
pragmatics can be viewed in a principled way as the study of the meaning
of what people utter in context. What a piece of language structure
means whether used to communicate or not would be semantics. Fasold
concludes that the research program initiated by Grice gives reasonable
promise to this dividing line between pragmatics and semantics if deixis
can be handled in some other way.





To summarize: Pragmatics involves how speakers use language in
contextualized social interactions -- how they do things with words, as
Austin would say. Semantics invites a focus on meaning and truth
conditions without regard to communication and context.

the case for the inderminancy of translation. The argument plays a role
in the indeterminacy thesis because Quine's reason for thinking that
independent controls do not exist in translation takes its force from
the argument that there are no linguistically neutral meanings. The
absence of linguistically neutral meanings is a prerequiste for the
indeterminacy of translation. [Read more ...](philosophy-of-language-answers.html)
