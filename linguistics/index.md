Ambiguity](types-of-ambiguity.html)


<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> [Philosophy of Language Questions and
Answers](philosophy-of-language-answers.html). The argument from "Two Dogmas" supplies the "missing" argument in
the case for the inderminancy of translation. The argument plays a role
in the indeterminacy thesis because Quine's reason for thinking that
independent controls do not exist in translation takes its force from
the argument that there are no linguistically neutral meanings. The
absence of linguistically neutral meanings is a prerequiste for the
indeterminacy of translation. [Read more ...](philosophy-of-language-answers.html)

5 Theoretical Linguistics
=============================



<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> [Facts Are Getting the Best of
Me!](linguistic-facts.html). "It seems clear that knowledge of grammatical rules is an essential
component of the interactive competence that speakers must have to
interact and cooperate with others. Thus if we can show that individuals
interacting through linguistic signs are effective in cooperating with
others in the conduct of their affairs, we have prima facie evidence for
the existince of shared grammatical structure. One need not as the
nineteenth-century normative grammarians did, and many modern educators
continue to do, attempt to judge an individual's basic linguistic
ability in reference to an a priori set of grammatical standards." --

Strategies,
p. 19. [Read more ...](linguistic-facts.html)





<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> [Hermogenes Was Right, Socrates
Wrong](cratylus.html). In Harris and Taylor's chapter on Plato's "Cratylus" in Landmarks in
Linguistic Thought, Cratylus takes the position that the form and
meaning of a word are inextricably related. For Cratylus, "everything,"
including Hermogenes, "has a right name of its own, which comes by
nature" even though some people, like Hermogenes, are named incorrectly
(Cratylus 383, as quoted in Harris and Taylor, p. 1). [Read more ...](cratylus.html)

6 Discourse Analysis
========================



<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> [Interpretation and
Indeterminancy](/da/da_indet.html). <img src="/images/0631166238.gif" align="right" />
Throughout the essay, I will argue a hard line: the exact meaning of a
speaker's utterance in a contextualized exchange is often indeterminate.
Within the context of the analysis of the teacher-pupil exchange, I will
argue for the superiority of interactional linguistics over speech act
theory because it reduces the indeterminacy and yields a more principled
interpretation, especially when the interactional approach is
complemented by elements from other sociologically influenced methods,
namely the ethnography of communication and Labovian sociolinguistics. [Read more ...](/da/da_indet.html)





<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> [A Wittgensteinian Approach to Discourse
Analysis](/da/lw_da.html). This essay seeks to take Wittgenstein's influence on discourse
analysis a step further by using his writings as the theoretical
foundation for an approach to analyzing discourse that is distinct from
speech act theory, <img src="/images/bkgenres.gif" align="right" />
<img src="/images/0816612285.gif" align="right" />
which stems from the analytic tradition in philosophy, and to suggest
that a Wittgenstein-inspired approach may actually be closer in spirit
and content to that of an unlikely candidate whose views, in contrast to
the analytic school, harbor a distinctly Continental flavor which has
come to influence critical theory: Mikhail Bakhtin. [Read more ...](/da/lw_da.html)
