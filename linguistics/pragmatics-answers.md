## How Do We Communicate More than We Literally Say?

**Question:** One of the concerns of pragmatics is accounting for how we communicate
more and/or different information than we literally say. Define and
discuss the role of speech act theory, conversational maxims and
implicatures, presuppositions, etc., in such pragmatic accounts of
communication. Be specific about the details of these theories and how
they provide the pragmatic accounts.

**Some answers:**

The prominent mechanisms that enable conversationalists to communicate
more or different information than is literally said include the
following:



-   implicatures
-   presuppositions
-   indexical expressions
-   some cases of anaphora
-   irony
-   metaphor
-   and the actions executed by an utterance


This page defines and describes the core theories of these mechanisms
and discusses the details of how they provide such pragmatic accounts of
communication. 


Communication itself, quite apart from mere speaking alone, often goes
beyond the bounds of what is literally said. To account for the gap
between what is said and what is communicated, several of the pragmatic
theories that I will outline below make general appeals to the
conventions and assumptions that trigger inferences, to intentions, or
to shared knowledge and beliefs. All the theories are concerned with
situated communication. Quite generally, communication, Georgia M. Green
says in <img src="/images/080582166X.gif" align="right" /> Pragmatics
and Natural Languague
Understanding,
presupposes achievement of the intended effect of verbal action upon the
addressee, whereas simply speaking does not, making communication \"the
successful interpretation by an addressee of a speaker\'s intent in
performing a linguistic act\" (Green 1989: 1).

(Gestures, facial expressions, tone, word choice, and other factors might play a role in this, but these factors are not discussed here.)

**Note:** Given the profoundly nuanced thought with which the
philosophers below address the complexities inherent in communication,
these short answers may not be complete, or completely accurate. I
suggest you address these questions with the full weight of your own
critical thought.


## Speech Act Theory


Speech Act Theory, formulated by the philosopher
<img src="/images/0674411528.gif" align="right" /> John L. Austin and later amended by John Searle, is expressly concerned with the
performance of such linguistic acts. Speech act theory accounts for how
we communicate more and/or different information than we literally say
by maintaining that utterances are used to perform acts. As Austin puts
it in How to Do Things with Words (1962: 6): \"The issuing of an
utterance is the performing of an action.\" Austin begins his theorizing
by analyzing a kind of sentence he calls an explicit performative,
examples of which are \"I wish you a happy new year,\" \"I hereby
promise to pay you back,\" and other sentences that employ performative
verbs like warn, bet, declare, dub, object, bequeath, assert, vote,
deny, etc. Such sentences, Austin points out, are used not so much to
say things, but to do things. Further: They do not describe or report
anything. Therefore, explicit performatives, Austin argues, cannot be
true or false but can go wrong.



To succeed, performatives must meet what Austin terms felicity
conditions, which are specifications for appropriate usage that address
matters of conventional procedures and effects as well as suitable
circumstances, feelings, and intentions. Failure to meet felicity
conditions result in problems of uptake (that is, understanding or
ratification), abuses, misfires, insincerities, and so forth. As such,
performative sentences achieve their corresponding actions because there
are specific conventions linking the words to institionalized
procedures. This link is one way in which more is communicated than
literally said.



Austin extends his argument beyond explicit performatives, however. He
argues that a wide class of utterances, if not all, are implicit
performatives, and in expanding his argument to include implicit
performatives, he shifts his focus to illocuationary acts, which is
\"the making of a statement, offer, promise, etc., in uttering a
sentence, by virtue of the conventional force associated with it or with
its explicit performative paraphrase\"
<img src="/images/0521294142.gif" align="right" /> (Levinson 1983: 236). The illocutionary act is what is directly achieved by the
conventional force associated with the issuance of a certain kind of
utterance in accord with a conventional procedure. Illocutionary acts,
in addition to covering such explicit performatives as promising, also
include statements. The illocutionary act carried out by an utterance
enables the saying of something to convey more than what is literally
said. And, in a point that I will return to in the final section of this
essay, if Austin\'s view is correct, the illocutionary act is one aspect
of language that makes it difficult to free a truth-conditional
semantics from pragmatic considerations: Performative sentences, whether
explicit or implicit, can scarcely be analyzed without taking into
account speaker and hearer, intention and understanding.



The theory of speech acts has been expanded and revised by, among
others, John Searle, who deals with indirect speech acts. Time
constraints prohibit addressing the many nuances of speech act theory
that have been proposed since Austin.


## Conversational Maxims and Implicatures


Conversational Maxims and Implicatures are the foundation of H.P.
Grice\'s pragmatic account of communication. To account for the
distinction between what is directly said and what is conveyed by an
utterance, Grice proposed that in conversing, participants proceed
according to an implicit assumption that he terms the cooperative
priniciple: \"Make your conversational contribution such as is required,
at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of
the talk exchange in which you are engaged.\" Another set of
assumptions, called conversational maxims, underlie the cooperative
priniple:



``` {.program}
1. Quality: Try to make your contribution one that 
   is true. 
(1) Do not say what you believe to be false.
(2) Do not say that for which you lack 
    adequate evidence.

2. Quantity
(1) Make your contribution as informative as is 
    required for the current purposes of the exchange.
(2) Do not make your contribution more informative
    than is required. 

3. Relation: Be relevant. 

4. Manner: Be perspicuous.
(1) Avoid obscurity of expression.
(2) Avoid ambiguity.
(3) Be brief (avoid unnecessary prolixity).
(4) Be orderly. 
```



Grice demonstrates that conversational participants convey meanings
beyond that which is said if they assume that the other is adhering to
the cooperative principle and its maxims. Conversationalists can deal
with the maxims in several ways: They can follow them, violate one of
them, opt out of one of them, sacrifice one to the other if they clash,
or flout them. Lying, for example, violates the maxim of quality. The
maxims derive their explanatory power from what happens when behavior
appears not to conform to them.



Thus, as Green (1989) explains, since speakers assume that hearers adopt
the cooperative principle and its maxims for interpreting speech
behavior, the speaker is free to exploit it, and to speak in such a way
that his behavior must be interpreted according to it. If the speaker\'s
remark seems irrelevant, the hearer will attempt to construct a sequence
of inferences that make it relevant or at least cooperative. This
exploitation of the maxims is the basic mechanism by which utterances
are used to convey more than they literally denote, and Grice called it
implicature. Other scholars have refined Grice\'s approach. Sperber and
Wilson (1986), for instance, have reduced the Gricean framework to
relevance. Time limitations prevent the summation of their views here.


## Meaning Based on Intention




Before proceeding to presuppositions, it is worth noting that Grice also
proposed a notion of meaning based on intention that further helps
account for how different or more information can be communicated than
is literally said. Grice describes his notion of intentional
communication as non-natural meaning, or meaningnn, characterizing it as
follows, with \"S\" standing for speaker, \"H\" for hearer, \"uttering
U\" for the utterance of a linguistic token, and \"z\" for roughly some
belief or volition invoked in H:

``` {.program}
S meantnn z by uttering U if and only if:

(i)  S intended U to cause some effect z in recipient H
(ii) S intented (i) to be achieved simply by H 
     recognizing the intention (i).
```



The above characterization by Grice states, according to Levinson
(1983), that communication consists in the speaker intending to cause
the hearer to think or do something just by getting the hearer to
recognize that the speaker is trying to cause that thought or action.
Other issues and problems aside, Grice\'s theory can explain the
difference between what is literally said and what is conveyed through
intention. For example, \"mathematics is fascinating\" said ironically
may be intended, despite its literal meaning, to communicate that
\"mathematics is rather boring\" and to produce the effect that the
speaker stops talking about mathematics.





## Metaphors


Metaphors are another mechanism by which more can be communicated than
literally said. Green (1989) maintains that metaphors like \"Eric is a
pig\" and \"that\'s a half-baked idea\" are interpreted figuratively
because the speaker and hearer both know that the literal interpretation
of such utterances would be nonrational, a view that accounts for
metaphorical uses of language under the cooperative principle and its
maxims. Both hearer and speaker know that Eric cannot be a pig, so both
assume that Eric is somehow like a pig. \"Thus the referring functions
inferred in the interpretation of metaphors involve the referring
function \`like x\'\" (Green 1989: 120-121).




## Presupposition


Presupposition, which like conversational implicature is another kind of
pragmatic inference, refers to propositions whose truth is taken for
granted in the utterance of a linguistic expression. The presupposed
propositions enable more to be conveyed than is literaly said. Morevoer,
presuppositions may communicate more or different information from what
is literally said because they involve not just a single implication but
a \"family of implications,\" which derives from the fact that the
presupposition is background, as Chierchia and McConnell-Ginet point out
(1990: 24). Several cases of presupposition have been distinguished. A
few representative cases and brief illustrative examples follow.
Existence presupposition in definite descriptions, expressions like
\"The present king of France is bald,\" pressuposes that there exists a
king of France.



Factive presupposition are typically associated with expressions that
take a sentential subject or object: The object complements of such
epistemic factives as know, realize, and the subject complements of
mean, prove, be obvious are considered to be presupposed true, as are
the complements of such emotive factives as regret, be glad, be
surprised, and amaze, among others. Inchoative verbs also have
complements presupposed to be true. Example: \"Kyle forgot that Stan
admires Kari\" presupposes that Stan admires Kari. Wh-questions, cleft
constructions, and iterative participles are also often associated with
presuppositions, as are the counterfactive verb pretend and the
counterfactual conditional of if-then constructions. Limitations of time
prevent the presentation of examples for all these possibilities.



The connotations of certain lexical items may also reflect
presuppositions. Such connotations enable more to be conveyed than is
literally said because of the properties that language users attribute
to the presumed intended referents of the words. A classic example of a
connotation presupposition is assassinate. Saying \"John assassinated
Kennedy\" presupposes that the killing was intentional, that Kennedy had
political power, and that removing Kennedy from that power was the
motivation behind the killing.



## Indexical Expressions


Indexical expressions, including deictic reference, also play a role in
accounting for how either more or different information is conveyed than
literally said. In his classic 1954 paper, Bar-Hillel argued that
indexicality is an inherent property of language and that many of the
declarative sentences people utter are indexical in that they involve
implicit references to the speaker, hearer, time or place of utterance,
etc., or the use of demonstratives, time adverbs, and tenses. The
reference of indexical expressions containing words like I, me, you,
here, then, now, this, etc., cannot be determined without taking into
account the context of the utterance. Minimally, the context required
for the interpretation of indexical expressions includes the time,
place, speaker, and topic of the utterance.

The argument from \"Two Dogmas\" supplies the \"missing\"

plays a role in the indeterminacy thesis because Quine\'s reason for

force from the argument that there are no linguistically neutral
meanings. The absence of linguistically neutral meanings is a
prerequiste for the indeterminacy of translation.

<img src="/images/0631166238.gif" align="right" />Throughout the essay, I will argue a hard line: the exact meaning of a
speaker\'s utterance in a contextualized exchange is often
indeterminate. Within the context of the analysis of the teacher-pupil
exchange, I will argue for the superiority of interactional linguistics
over speech act theory because it reduces the indeterminacy and yields a
more principled interpretation, especially when the interactional
approach is complemented by elements from other sociologically
influenced methods, namely the ethnography of communication and Labovian
sociolinguistics.
