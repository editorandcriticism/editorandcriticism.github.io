1.  Keith Donnellan's definition of analyticity is warmed-over Frege,
    Jerrold Katz says. Yet Donnellan's target here is Frege and Carnap.
2.  Donnellan begins by questioning approaches such as Carnap's.
    Donnellan wonders: How can Carnap know if he is using the correct
    meaning postulates and if they will work.
3.  Test case: "All whales are mammals." First, would the applicability
    of the term apply to all possible cases? Answering this question in
    the affirmative is required to meet the condition of necessity.
    Second, what if there is disagreement on the application of the
    term, as may be the case with applying *mammal* to *whale*.
4.  Donnellan's point: If there's a fact of the matter, the application
    must be made in advance. He doubts that it is fixed in advance.
5.  Donnellan's conclusion: The criteria of application cannot be
    determined in advance. How do we know to what criteria to appeal to
    in such cases as disagreement between a sailor and a zoologist on
    whales as mammals? Thus, is there some objective criterion that can
    determine the meaning of a term? No, Donnellan would say.

the case for the inderminancy of translation. The argument plays a role
in the indeterminacy thesis because Quine's reason for thinking that
independent controls do not exist in translation takes its force from
the argument that there are no linguistically neutral meanings. The
absence of linguistically neutral meanings is a prerequiste for the
indeterminacy of translation. [Read more ...](philosophy-of-language-answers.html)
