<i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></i> OpenStack Swift Object Storage on EMC Isilon Scale-Out NAS: The EMC Isilon scale-out storage platform provides object storage by exposing the OpenStack Object Storage API as a set of Representational State Transfer (REST) web services over HTTP. The objects that you store through the Swift API can be accessed as directories and files through NFS, SMB, and HDFS. The result is a standard method of securely integrating data-intensive applications with the Isilon storage platform and then sharing the data with other applications, such as Hadoop and Apache Spark.

<i class="fa fa-file-text-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> [Storage Optimization](/cc/web-page-copy.html): Tune Your Management Strategy for Unstructured Data: The explosion of unstructured data in the face of shrinking IT budgets demands efficient storage management. Virtualization, deduplication, tiering, charge-back models, and service-level agreements are all essential, but to truly excel you need to manage your unstructured data in the context of its life cycle and your business strategy. 

<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> [Tune Your Management Strategy for
Unstructured Data](optimization.pdf): The explosion of unstructured data
in the face of shrinking IT budgets demands efficient storage
management. Virtualization, deduplication, tiering, charge-back models,
and service-level agreements are all essential, but to truly excel you
need to manage your unstructured data in the context of its life cycle
and your business strategy.

<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> [Exception Monitoring and
Reporting](exception-monitoring.pdf): Unmanaged piles of unstructured
data can be unnerving. When file servers overflow with documents that
might contain sensitive, proprietary, or confidential content, you get
that sinking feeling: There might be information in there that violates
one or more compliance regulations. And if exposed, whether through an
internal or external threat, it could damage the reputation of your
company, undermine your competitive advantage, and lead to legal
problems and fines. Identity-aware exception monitoring and reporting is
an effective way to get visibility into anomalies around access to
unstructured data.

<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> [File Activity
Monitoring](file-activity-monitoring.pdf): As unstructured data rapidly
accumulates on file servers and NAS systems, a new security requirement
is becoming paramount: file activity monitoring. It stems from the
pressing need to track and protect sensitive unstructured data.

<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> [Likewise Data Analytics and
Governance](data-analytics-governance.pdf): Unstructured data is growing
faster than all other types of data and will increase by 800 percent
during the next five years. Analysts are referring to it as the big-data
explosion. But big data brings new challenges. Because 40 percent of it
typically contains sensitive information, compliance regulations or
internal policies mandate security. At the same time, workers depend on
easy, rapid access to do their job. Security, then, must be balanced
with availability. Easier said than done: Data silos, access barriers,
different protocols, security gaps, and a lack of control stand firmly
in the way, increasing risks and costs. Likewise Data Analytics and
Governance unites identity, security, and storage to overcome the
challenges of managing unstructured data.

<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> [Storage Access
Control](cross-platform-storage-access-control.pdf): As heterogeneous
networks increasingly spawn data silos -- file servers segmented by
storage protocol -- the files of Unix users are typically stored on
separate servers from the files of Windows users, making it hard to
secure unstructured data with a centralized access control system. By
providing a cross-platform file server with an integrated access control
system, Likewise Storage Services secures access to unstructured data
regardless of whether a user is accessing it from a Unix or a Windows
computer.

<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> [Reporting Features for IT

<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> [FISMA Compliance for File Servers
and Storage Systems](fisma.pdf): FISMA mandates that you protect

controls. Technical security controls for unstructured data stored on
file servers and NAS systems take the form of authentication, access
control, auditing, monitoring, and reporting.

access and utilization -- information you can use to improve the
performance of storage systems.

<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> [Manage Unstructured Data on
Virtual File Servers and NAS Systems](virtualization.pdf): Although
virtualization saves money, it can result in VM sprawl: Virtual machines
multiplying into file servers faster than you can figure out what's on
them and who is using them. As unstructured data expands and virtual
file servers proliferate, visibility into the data-usage patterns that
take place on virtual filers improves capacity planning, utilization,
compliance, and security.

<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> [Monitoring Unstructured Data on

Enterprise integrates computers running the Solaris operating system
with Microsoft Active Directory, yielding a range of benefits for users,
system administrators, and managers. Solaris users get single sign-on.
System administrators rest easy with the knowledge that users are
securely authenticated with the Kerberos protocol. Managers see their
operational costs drop as Solaris computers are centrally managed with
Active Directory. Security managers find help in their quest for
regulatory compliance.

<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> [Managing Unstructured Data for
Sarbanes-Oxley](sox.pdf): The requirements for SOX compliance represent
something of a shifting goal. Instead of specific IT compliance
requirements, Sarbanes-Oxley relies on general principles. Problem is,
they are subject to interpretation by auditors. Different auditors might
ask different questions; expectations might change from year to year;
controls deemed adequate one year might be insufficient the next.

So the key question becomes: How can you put in place internal controls
that address different auditors, shifting objectives, and various risks?
A powerful approach is to implement internal controls that establish a
strong foundation for Sarbanes-Oxley compliance.
