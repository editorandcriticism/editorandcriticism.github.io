### About



**D**eveloped by [Steve Hoenisch](/md/bio.html), Criticism.Com took life
in 1995 as Critical Mass. It became Criticism.Com in 1996. In the
beginning, it focused solely on media criticism and political action but
evolved to cover [linguistics](/linguistics/),
[philosophy](/philosophy/), [social science](md/weber1.html), and
[XML](/dita/). There is also some random content on skiing and travel. Much of the site's established content is on [Media Criticism](/md/).
