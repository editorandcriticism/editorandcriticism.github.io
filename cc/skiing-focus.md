# Skiing

Done: This is the final, up to date version as of Sept. 20, 2017.


## Critical Keys for Skiing and Everything

1. Buckle 2 lower buckles on ski boots to a medium level of snugness to keep foot from sliding and crashing into its encasing. Counterintuitive but works much better in preventing foot bang. 

2. Neck is going out--by extending forward and collapsing--on left-footed turns to the right, especially on steep terrain when I have to bend further forward and reach with left arm to pole plant. Reactivate and realign neck by taking up a left-footed turn posture and then pulling neck back and to the right. Therefore: 3D RTN, 3D DNF, 3D facilitated segment with yellow band (FS), 3D head band backs and turns, etc. See exs.md and sh-exs.md.

3. Breathe into esp. left lower trap. **Relax neck back and up on exhale. Float head high. Extend thoracic-cervical junction to elongate neck and eliminate crease.**

4. Remember to stay low between turns, in a squat. Flex knees more between turns, then extend legs into turn to create dynamic extension and retraction. It helps a lot. 

5. Make sure to prevent the triple threat: No time pressure, no need to prove or reprove performance, no insecurity. No type A behaviors, no performance anxiety. Breathe and have fun by being mindfully present in nature. 

## Skiing Focus

1. Breathe. 

1. Stay low between turns, in a squat. Flex knees more between turns, then extend legs into turn to create dynamic extension and retraction. **Butt back.**

2. Skis wider.

3. Steer with the inside ski.

4. Drive knees forward into tighter power straps and go downhill with chest. Keep chest up. Make sure before skiing that you have adequate thoracic extension, lower back mobility, and hip mobility, especially after driving. 

4. Turn on PF and TA, bring pelvis into belly button to activate sacrum multifidus and hence glutes. Relax shoulders back and down and then connect shoulder blades with scarum multifidus to compact body and set posture.   

5. Breathe laterally. Don't let stomach distend. 

6. No counter rotation. Chest up and downhill.

7. Pull uphill leg (esp. R) into socket slightly. 

1. Lower traps slightly on to keep chest up at thoracic-cervical junction while keeping neck straight, tall, and long. Float your head high. Thoracic extension. Chin slight tucked.

1. Neck elongated and back and slightly shifted to the R. R. multifidus on at L4-L5 etc. R. adductor engaged and R. foot level.
