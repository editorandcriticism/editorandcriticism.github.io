magazine.\



1 Introduction
==============

<img src="../images/skiwork.gif" align="right" />
**H**ere's a list of eleven great jobs that are reasonably obtainable
for the well-prepared, well-seasoned or enterprising ski bum. Reasonably
obtainable, however, means that the list ignores such great but scarce
or specialized jobs as full-time freestyle coach, snowboard operations
coordinator and helicopter skiing guide.





2 Live Ski Reporter, Killington
===============================

Reporters ski Killington's terrain and then staff the resort's 900
number--the Live Ski Connection--answering skiers' questions about the
best runs for their ability level and where the best conditions can be
found.





3 Snowboard Patrol, Snowbird
============================

These patrollers board all day while making sure their single-planking
comrades are ripping with a conscience. But you'd probably have to work
at the 'Bird for at least a season or two to land one of these newly
formed, coveted jobs.





4 Snowmaker, Sunday River
=========================

<img src="../images/0879517395.jpg" align="right" />
Some hate it, others love it. If you don't like hard work, snowmaking
won't strike you as a great job. But those who don't mind physical work
will reap this job's fine rewards: independence, a lot of ski time, an
abundance of early season work and plenty of miles spent riding
snowmobiles. Sunday River has three shifts for its 50 snowmakers, day,
night and swing. Of course, snowmaking jobs, like many others, are
available at various resorts and are not all that hard to get. Last
winter, I landed one at Park City, Utah, with a single phone call.





5 Ski Instructor, Deer Valley or Park City
==========================================

The town of Park City is rife with rumors of ski instructors being
tipped very generously--word has it one instructor received a new
four-wheel-drive vehicle after teaching a client for a season. Solid
skiers with the potential to teach well may obtain ski instructor jobs
at Deer Valley or Park City Ski Area by going through the ski schools'
clinics, both of which are usually held in November. Although the job
doesn't pay well the first year, good money and rewarding times await
those willing to stick around.





6 Ski Patrol, Squaw Valley
==========================

What better job
than <img src="../images/0809226456.gif" align="right" />
throwing bombs over the edge of the Palisades and then skiing down after
a storm dumped two feet of Sierra powder. The job has special
requirements, such as EMT or advanced life-saving certification, but the
positions are obtainable for the persistent, especially if you have
experience.





7 Lift Operator, Timberline Lodge, Mt. Hood
===========================================

OK, so lift operator isn't the best job in ski country. But what if it
offered the possibility of year-round employment, year-round skiing and
plenty of ski time. Some Timberline lifties work night-skiing shifts
during the winter so they can ski days, but if you have to work days,
you can always ski nights. And the Cascades deliver a season-end bonus:
killer backcountry skiing in spring and summer.





8 Night Crew, Mammoth Mountain
==============================

There's about 50 positions available at Mammoth Mountain performing
janitorial duties from 4 or 5 pm till midnight, giving night crew
workers all day--everyday--for skiing.





9 Children's Instructor, Crested Butte
======================================

This ski area seeks skiers who have an understanding
of<img src="../images/1878239643.gif" align="right" />
children to teach them how to ski. The job does not require
certification; Crested Butte provides training. A great job in a great
place for skiers who like working with kids.





10 On-Mountain Restaurant Worker, Alta
======================================

Food service jobs at the independently owned Watson Cafe come with a
built-in perk: You can live on the mountain, giving you an advantage on
getting first tracks after the storms that dump more than 400 inches
annually at Alta. Watson Cafe--formerly called Watson Shelter--hires 32
people, 16 of whom live on the mountain, to work as waiters, waitresses,
bussers, cooks, dishwashers and food servers. However, if you want one
of these jobs, which include a ski pass, you'll need to apply early.





11 Skier Services, Vail
=======================

Aspiring flacks will be attracted to this on-the-mountain public
relations job in which the workers wear ski clothes instead of dress
suits. The position entails answering questions for skiers,  helping set
up for special events and helping the ski patrol. Vail, which has a
Skier Services staff of 30, usually hires several new people for the job
each
year.<img src="../images/0962193577.gif" align="right" />





12 Waitress or Waiter, Just About Anywhere
==========================================

For many ski bums, waiting tables nights at a ski resort or town
epitomizes the ultimate job. Having just quit their real jobs to work at
a resort for a season, many skiers imagine themselves as waiters or
waitresses during their preseason daydreams. And for good reason: What
ski bum could ask for more than good tips, free food at night and days
free for skiing.
