Here's a list of courses that I took during graduate school. Most of the
courses were in the sociology, philosophy, psychology, or linguistics
department at the Graduate Center, City University of New York (CUNY). I
also took graduate courses at Hartford University and the University of
Oregon (where I got my bachelor's degree in philosophy).
