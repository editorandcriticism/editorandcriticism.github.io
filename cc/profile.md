**Some of my favorite places:** Williamsburg and Greenpoint, Brooklyn; the Village; Cascade Head, Oregon; Little Cottonwood Canyon, Utah; Alpental; Mt. Hood; Rainier National Park; Waitsfield, Vermont; Amsterdam. 


Streets and city parks have always been a big part of my life. I like to walk around cities and have spent a lot of my life simply walking (and bicycling) the streets of Portland, Manhattan, and Brooklyn. Some of the streets that I naturally gravitated to in Manhattan were Christopher Street in the West Village, First Avenue in the East Village, 14th Street, and Bleecker and MacDougal in Greenwich Village. When I lived in New York, I hung out in Washington Square Park, in Central Park, and in McCarren Park in Greenpoint. In Williamsburg and Greenpoint, Brooklyn, I spent so many years walking Bedford Ave., Metropolitan Ave., Manhattan Ave., Lorimer Street, Driggs, Devoe, Grand, and Graham that these places now live inside me. 

**Places I like in Portland** and the surrounding area:

-   Palmer.
-   Zigzag Canyon.
-   Government Camp.
-   Oak's Park Roller Rink.



**Some Highlights:** Helicopter off Palisades at Squaw Valley; Robert D. Putnam cites essay on Weber; Weber gets best of social science for web award; backcountry skiing at Alpental, Crystal, and Mt. Hood.

**Some social and cultural critics I like:** Marshall Berman, Robert D. Putnam, Patricia Clough, and [Lester Faigley](https://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~faigley/about.html) --- the [first couple of chapters](https://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~faigley/work/frag.html) of *Fragments of Rationality: Postmodernity and the Subject of Composition* is an exceptionally cogent discussion of postmodernism and the related structural changes that have, since 1963, transformed America. Other theorists whose work I admire: [Catherine Wilson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3Gby6huoZ8). 

**Theorists** I like in a way that hasn't passed: Mikhail Bakhtin, Roland Barthes, Michel Foucault, [Max Weber](https://www.criticism.com/md/weber1.html), Karl Marx, Jurgen Habermas, Max Horkheimer, Walter Benjamin, Herbert Marcuse, Siegfried Kracauer, and especially Raymond Williams (*The Country and the City* is one of my favorite books). 

**Writers** I like in a way that hasn't passed: Bruce Chatwin, Paul
Bowles.

**Ideas I like:** I embrace critical theory's historical ideal of human emancipation and freedom from domination. Two of the practical ramifications of such a position are to look for mutuality and equality in interpersonal relationships and to work in a place devoid of hierarchy. The political ramifications are obvious: Working to put in place systems of participatory democracy governed by self-rule and economic systems governed by the principles of social justice. 

I also embrace the mission of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which was, according to its founding statement of purpose, "organized around the principles of social and economic justice, a non-discriminatory society, and national priorities which represent the interests of all people, not just the wealthy and powerful." 

<!-- **Some of my favorite books:** The Country and the City, by Raymond Williams. ...  -->

**A thesis I like:** Using current nativist thinking in moral theory to motivate a reformulation of the [fact-value](https://www.criticism.com/md/weber1.html) paradigm in social science to render research relevant only if it resists and undermines the social and economic systems that dominate, [exploit](https://www.thenation.com/print/article/160410/faulty-towers-crisis-higher-education), hurt, and trap people. 

**More ideas that I like:** Empathy and kindness as practices of resistance; re-evaluating ideas that are [uncritically adopted](https://www.theamericanscholar.org/the-disadvantages-of-an-elite-education/) from the system in which we are embedded; substance over image; literature as social knowledge; the dialogic voice and the dialogic imagination; inclusion over ritual [exclusion](https://www.theamericanscholar.org/the-disadvantages-of-an-elite-education/); integration over dispossession; freedom from the iron cage and the silicon cage through economic justice; organic social interaction in the village-like neighborhoods of the inner city.

happening:

## Book Projects

Major contributor: *American Encyclopedia of the Democratic Party and
the Republican Party* (I wrote on the same topics for both volumes). The
encyclopedia, published by [M.E.
Sharpe](https://www.mesharpe.com/mall/resultsa.asp?Title=The+Encyclopedia+of+the+Republican+Party+and+The+Encyclopedia+of+the+Democratic+Party),
won the Choice Outstanding Academic Book Award in 1997.

## Selected Academic Work

Most of the useful academic work that I've produced has focused on text
linguistics, Wittgenstein, the relationship between language and
psychoanalysis, approaches to discourse analysis, Max Weber's approach
to social science, and objectivity in social science. Most of my formal
training has been in critical theory, discourse analysis, analytic
philosophy, cognitive psychology, and theoretical linguistics.

-   [Max Weber's View of Objectivity in Social
    Science](/md/weber1.html). This essay was named best of the web for
    social science in 2003 by Encyclopaedia Britannica. The essay was
    cited by Robert D. Putnam, Professor of Public Policy at Harvard
    University, in his [presidential
    address](https://www.apsanet.org/media/PDFs/PresidentialAddresses/2002AddrPUTNAM.pdf)
    to the American Political Science Association at the 2002 APSA
    annual meeting.

### Back to the Present

How do we maintain our humanity, sanity, empathy, privacy, and cybersecurity in the face of change and digital transformation? 

Simple answers work best: Breathe. Meditate. Practice mindfulness and kindness. Move. Go outside. Travel. 

Some complicated answers might help, too: Combine critical theory and science with critical thinking and reading. Re-evaluate ideas and values that are uncritically adopted from the system in which we are embedded. Avoid totalizing. 

The future is critical. <i class="fa fa-coffee" aria-hidden="true"></i>
