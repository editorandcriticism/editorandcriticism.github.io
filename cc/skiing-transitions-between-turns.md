title: 'Functional Dry-Land Training for Transitions Between Turns in Skiing'
---




One of the hardest parts of skiing is the transition from one turn to
the next. Doing it well requires finesse to control pressure and then
release it at the right moment -- as Bode Miller says, it's a "dynamic
balance move." (For some slow motion footage of Bode while his coach
talks about transitions between turns, see the video at [http://www.sportskool.com/videos/advanced-turns](http://www.sportskool.com/videos/advanced-turns).

The transition starts when you plant your pole and release the pressure
of your carve. It continues until you transfer the energy to the next
turn and begin to carve new turn.

So the question is this: How can you create a dry-land exercise that
simulates a dynamic balance move in which you need to control the
buildup of pressure and release it at the right instant to have your
legs cross under your quiet upper body?
