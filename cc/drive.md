### 1 Bargain Trips


**H**ow can overland travelers save hundreds of dollars in rental-car
costs during cross-country or intercity trips? Easy: By linking up with
the nationwide network of so-called drive-away companies that use
independent travelers to deliver cars to a mutual destination for them.

The deal works like this: Drivers receive free use of the car for a
certain number of days and miles in
exchange<img src="/images/0316353299.gif" align="right" /> for driving it to an agreed-upon destination by a set date. Besides a
small processing fee, usually about \$10, that some companies charge,
the driver pays only for gasoline.

Example: While traveling
recently from Portland, Ore., to New York City, I saved about \$1000 in
car-rental costs by lining up an auto with a drive-away company and
using it for the nine-day trip. My total cost, excluding gasoline: \$6.

In fact, not only did I use the drive-away vehicle, a 1991 Toyota
Four-Runner with all the luxuries, to tour the country, but I also used
it to move many of my personal effects, including a bicycle.

Similarly, I recently drove a drive-away car from San Francisco to
Portland for \$14, excluding gasoline. A rental would have cost about
\$110 a day, plus gas.

### 2 Let Your Fingers Do the Rockin'


**H**ere's how to line up a car: First, check the Yellow Pages for the
telephone numbers of drive-away companies, usually listed either under
"drive-away" or under "automobile transporters." Then start making
calls. Although not all car-transportation companies use independent
travelers, there usually are several that do in every large city. After
finding such a company, tell them your destination and when you can
leave. It's best to start calling at least a week or two before you plan
to take off (even earlier for cross-country trips), but two or three
days beforehand often works, too. But generally, the earlier you can
start calling, the better. It helps to be flexible in the day of
departure.
<img src="/images/0140042598.gif" align="right" /> Certain
requirements, which vary among companies, must be met to qualify as a
driver. All companies require a current driver's license, and you will
probably be asked to show additional identification while filling out
their forms. You may be asked about your driving record and you may be
fingerprinted. You should be prepared to provide references and
telephone numbers for them in both your home city and your destination.

Most companies require a cash deposit of \$200 to \$350, which is fully
refunded after the vehicle is delivered as agreed. Be sure to find out
on the phone the company's exact requirements, especially the amount of
the cash deposit, before you agree to transport a car for it. Some
companies also require that you clean the inside and wash the outside of
the vehicle before delivery.

### 3 Drawbacks

**A**lthough drive-away companies can save travelers a lot of money,
there are drawbacks. It may be hard to line up a car to your destination
within the days you want to travel. You may have to be willing to depart
according to their schedule rather than yours. And it's often tough to line up a car
to destinations outside metropolitan areas. You'll find it much easier,
for instance, to get a car from [Chicago](drivinfo.html) to Atlanta than
from Chicago to, say, Augusta. So be open to taking the bus or train for
the final leg of your journey.

While traveling, you must follow certain rules laid down by the company,
such as limits on the time of day during which you can travel. Some
companies, for instance, prohibit driving between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. to
ensure that drivers don't crash the car from lack of sleep.

The company may also place restrictions on the routes you can take, but
leeway in choosing the route increases with the length of the trip. On my San Francisco-Portland trip, I was
required to take Interstate 5. Before leaving on my Portland-New York
trip, however, I was allowed to choose the specific route, in
consultation with the traffic agent, using the freedom to explore the
Blue Highways of the northern states.

Many companies also forbid drivers to eat or drink in the vehicle, which
doesn't seem like an unreasonable request until you find yourself in the
middle of Oklahoma pining for a cup of strong coffee. While the
companies will often insist that you follow such rules on short
intercity trips, they may relax them for cross-country trips,
acknowledging that you may not be able to avoid driving after 10 p.m. to
make your next motel or campsite.<img src="/images/6300183416.gif" align="right" />


Another drawback is that you must delivery the car to the person or
corporation that hired the drive-away company to transport the car. This
could leave you stranded at a bus stop in deepest suburbia, a
possibility that means you should travel light.

But for the flexible, money-conscious traveler, these drawbacks are
minor compared with the benefits of using drive-away companies:
inexpensive transportation and the time to drift across the country by
car, exploring its cities and countryside.
