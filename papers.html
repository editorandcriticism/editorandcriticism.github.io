View of Objectivity in Social Science</a>: This essay seeks to shed
light on Weber’s view of the applicability of objectivity by answering a
question that dogs Weberian scholarship: Was Weber an advocate of
value-free social science? <a href="/md/weber1.pdf">Download PDF</a>

<p><i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> <a href="/md/tech.html">The Myth of
Psychoanalysis: Wittgenstein Contra Freud</a>: In this essay, my central
thesis is that if, as Wittgenstein says, Freudian psychoanalysis is
based in myth, its application to actual psychological problems does
not, indeed cannot, resolve them. Instead, all it can do is clarify them
or present them in a different light. Implicit in my argument is that
this is how Wittgenstein thought of the results of psychoanalysis, much
like he thought of the application of his philosophical technique to
philosophical problems, especially those of metaphysics, ethics, and
aesthetics. As such, Wittgenstein is also subverting a larger myth: that
the insights gained in psychoanalysis lead to the scientific resolution
of psychological problems. <a href="/md/tech.pdf">Download PDF</a>

<p><i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> <a href="/da/lw_da.html">A
Wittgensteinian Approach to Discourse Analysis</a>: This essay takes
Wittgenstein’s influence on discourse analysis a step further by using
his writings as the theoretical foundation for an approach to analyzing
discourse that is distinct from speech act theory, which stems from the
analytic tradition in philosophy. The essay suggests that a
Wittgenstein-inspired approach is closer in spirit and content to that
of an unlikely candidate whose views, in contrast to the analytic
school, harbor a distinctly Continental flavor and influence critical
theory: Mikhail Bakhtin. <a href="/da/lw_da.pdf">Download PDF</a>

href="/md/the_sign.html">Saussure’s Sign</a>: The sign, the signifier,
and the signified are concepts of the school of thought known as
structuralism, founded by Ferdinand de Saussure, a Swiss linguist,
during lectures he gave between 1907 and 1911 at the University of
Geneva. His views revolutionized the study of language, inaugurated
modern linguistics, and influenced critical theory. The central tenet of
structuralism is that the phenomena of human life are unintelligible
except through their network of relationships, making the sign and the
system (or structure) in which the sign is embedded primary concepts. As
such, a sign–for instance, a word–gets its meaning only in relation to
or in contrast with other signs in a system of signs. <a

Analysis of Kellner’s Theory of Media Culture</a> In an era when the
media have grown to be one of the most dominant forms of culture in
North American — so dominant, in fact, that the they can now be seen as
the pinnacle of commercial culture — an explanatory theory of the media
becomes paramount. Yet considering the intimate relationship between
culture and media and that, for many, the media have become their
culture, a theory that views the media outside the context of culture
will be afflicted with myopia. Thus, for completeness, a theory of the
media requires a firm connection to culture in its every step. Douglas
Kellner, in his book <em>Media Culture: Cultural Studies, Identity and
Politics Between the Modern and the Postmodern</em>, sets out to make
these connections. <a href="/md/kellner.pdf">Download PDF</a>

Structure Analysis of Accomplished English Prose</a> This study analyzes
the topical structure of accomplished essays and compares the results
with the topical structure tacitly preferred by assessors in their
judgments of student essays. The paper examines whether the same
patterns of topical structure that are rewarded by assessors in student
writing, as reported by previous studies, are in fact used by
professionals writing within a similar genre. The results of the
comparison help determine the extent to which essays written for such
tests as Educational Testing Service’s TOEFL Test of Written English are
evaluated in accordance with the unstated norms of topical structure in
comparable accomplished English prose. <a

Analysis</a>: This essay argues a hard line: the exact meaning of a
speaker’s utterance in a contextualized exchange is often indeterminate.
Interactional linguistics, however, reduces the indeterminacy and yields
a more principled interpretation than other approaches to discourse
analysis. <a href="/da/da_indet.pdf">Download PDF</a>
