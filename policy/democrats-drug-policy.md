1 Approaches to Drug Control
===================================================================

Members of the Democratic Party, with their big city constituency, have
long had a vested interest in federal drug control policy. They have, at
times, played forceful roles in the often bipartisan issue. Many in the
Democratic Party have stood firmly behind the need for drug control;
splits within the party usually have taken place over the priorities,
funding levels, or strategies for controlling drugs. Most moderate and
liberal Democrats have favored an approach that emphasizes prevention
and treatment over interdiction and enforcement, while the more
conservative Southern Democrats have often favored a tougher, law and
order approach to the problem.



During the 1990s, some members of the Democratic Party increasingly
began to speak in favor of legalization, arguing that the drug war has
failed and that legalization, coupled with extensive treatment programs,
would be the best policy for controlling drug abuse.



From 1976 through the 102d Congress, the three Democrats who served as
the chairman of the House Select Narcotics Abuse and Control Committee
played important roles in drug policy. They were Representatives Lester
L. Wolff, Leo C. Zeferetti, and Charles B. Rangel, all from New York
City.










2 An Ill-Conceived, Racist War on Drugs
=========================================================================================


Yet despite the involvement of many Democrats in drug policy, it was
conservative Republican President Ronald Reagan who elevated the issue
to the national spotlight with his war on drugs of the early 1980s.
Since, the issue has remained of paramount public and political
importance, arising during every presidential election since 1980 as
members of both parties articulated their approaches for handling the
problem. The issue became particularly heated during the 1988
presidential campaigns. Jesse Jackson, a candidate in the 1988
Democratic Party presidential primaries, tried to make drug control into
a major foreign policy issue. Jackson called for a drug czar to
coordinate the efforts of the agencies fighting the drug war, more money
for the Coast Guard, and possible use of the military. Michael Dukakis,
the eventual 1988 Democratic presidential candidate, made similar
demands.



Unfortunately for the Democrats, however, it was Republican George Bush
who won the 1988 presidential election, and he lost no time in
continuing former conservative Republican President Ronald Reagan\'s war
on drugs. Passage of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 created a
cabinet-level drug czar, and Bush appointed ultra-conservative William
J. Bennett to the post. He focused on combatting street sales of drugs
and on financing antidrug efforts in the countries from which the drugs
were originating.


3 Democrats Against Injustice
=====================================================================


Elected members of the Democratic Party have often opposed the law and
order tactics used by such previous Republican administrations as those
of Bush, Reagan, and Richard M. Nixon, who helped encourage the 1970
passage of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act,
which reinforced narcotics penalties. The Democrats instead favor
expanding education and other prevention programs along with treatment
and rehabilitation facilities.



During the mid 1990s, the administration of Democratic President Bill
Clinton emphasized treatment for addicts while limiting support for
overseas antidrug campaigns. Republicans, led by conservative Newt
Gingrich of Georgia, the Speaker of the House, have argued that the
administration\'s approach fails to effectively diminish the supply of
illicit drugs. Yet such hardline policies as determinate sentencing
advocated by Republicans have resulted in a U.S. prison population
proportionately larger than that of any other country.
