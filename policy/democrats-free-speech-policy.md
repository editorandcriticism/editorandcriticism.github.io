1 Introduction
=======================================


Despite the guarantees of the First Amendment, challenges to and for
freedom of speech and expression have been waged through U.S. history
over a variety of issues, the most common of which have been the press,
radio and television, communism, sedition, public school textbooks,
pornography, and art, including music. The advent of new technology,
such as radio and, recently, the Internet, has often been followed by
restrictive legislation.



The contemporary Democratic Party has tended to take a more liberal view
toward freedom of expression, being in general less likely than
Republicans to oppose expression without limitation. The Democratic
Party\'s record on free speech, despite such blemishes as President
Woodrow Wilson\'s appointment in 1919 of A. Mitchell Palmer as attorney
general, does not approximate the attacks on liberty perbetrated by such
members of the Republican Party as Senators Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin
and Knute Nelson of Minnesota. Yet members of the Democratic Party have
at times taken strong action against free expression. There have also
been splits within the Democratic Party, often between conservative
Southern Democrats and their more liberal, prolabor Northern colleagues.







The era surrounding World War I stands out as being marked by repressive
anti-speech policies, often proposed by leading Democrats, and
subsequent violations of personal liberties. The Congress of 1919 and
1920, for instance, introduced more than 70 measures aimed at
restricting, among other activities, peacetime sedition, the display of
the red flag, and the sending of seditious material in the mail. A
Senate committee headed by Less S. Overman, a Southern Democrat of North
Carolina, focused on attempting to suppress radical and Bolshevik
activities with such restrictive legislation as the Overman bill, which
did not pass.



Of greater flagrance in attempting to limit speech was the Sedition Bill
of 1918. Introduced into the House by Democratic Representative Martin
Davey of Ohio at the urging of U.S. Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer,
the bill sought to define as punishable sedition any activity aimed at
changing the government or the laws of the United States. Endorsed by
President Wilson, a Democrat, the act passed both houses to become law.



2 Red Scare: The Palmer Raids
=====================================================================


On January 2, 1920, the Department of Justice, under the direction of
Attorney General Palmer, an appointee of President Wilson, carried out
what have come to be known as the Palmer raids \-- perhaps the most
repressive actions of the \"red scare\" period. More than 4,000 people
labeled as communists or associated with the Communist Labor parties
were arrested in 33 cities. Palmer said they were plagued with a
\"disease of evil thinking.\"



After World War I, in 1930, Representative Hamilton Fish of New York,
called for a House investigation of communists\' activities and urged
formation of a committee to hear testimony.


3 The Fairness Doctrine
=========================================================


Another piece of Democrat-propeled legislation that runs counter to the
party\'s liberal traditions is the Alien Registration Act, otherwise
known as the Smith Act after Democrat Howard W. Smith of Virginia, who
introduced in 1939. The act forbade advocating the violent overthrown of
the government and the publication of writing toward that end. It passed
both houses in 1940 and was signed into law by Democratic President
Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1948, the act was used by the Roosevelt
administration\'s Justice Department to indict leaders of the American
Communist Party.



The advent of public radio created partisan conflict between Republicans
and Democrats. The Radio Act of 1927, passed at the suggestion of
Republican Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, himself appointed by
Republican President Warren G. Harding, required broadcasters to act in
the \"public interests\"\--a phrase that allowed a Republican-appointed
commission to evaluate program content when considering the renewal of
stations\' licenses. In 1929, the committee denied a request by the
Chicago Federation of Labor to expand its programming. Then in 1931, the
committee rejected the station\'s renewal application based on the
station\'s programming content. The decision started a battle between
the Republicans and the Democrats. It culminated in 1934 with the
Communications Act, of which the New Deal Democrats won passage to
rewrite the Radio Act and establish a Federal Communications Commission,
or FCC. After seeing how newspapers had in general supported Republcans,
the New Deal Democrats wanted to ensure that radio and television would
be nonpartisan. The act strenghtened the provisions of the law applying
equal time for candidates and ballot measures.







But it wasn\'t until 1949 that the FCC promulgated the Fairness
Doctrine, which required the presentation of contrasting viewpoints on
controversial issues of pulbic consequence. Yet partisan conflict over
the broadcasting policy did not end there. Five decades later, the FCC
repealed the Fairness Doctrine under pressure from Conservative
Republican President Ronald Reagan. Soon after, Senator Ernest Hollings,
a moderate conservative Democrat, fought to reinstate the rule.



The advent of wide-ranging public access to the Internet has also
prompted calls for restrictive legislation, following the pattern
evident throughout the 20th century: Politicians react with regulatory
fervor to the unknown effects of new technology. The Exon-Coats
Amendment, proposed as part of the telecommunications reform bill, aimed
at making \"indecent communication\" available to Cyberspace users
younger than 18. As the amendment\'s name implies, it was drafted by
Senators Jim Exon, a Nebraska Democrat, and Daniel R. Coats, an Indiana
Republican.
