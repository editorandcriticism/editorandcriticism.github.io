1 A Leading Role
===========================================

Members of the Republican Party have played a lead role in the often
bipartisan issue of drug control policy. The party has generally stood
unified on the need for drug control; splits within the party usually
have taken place over the priorities, funding levels, or strategies for
controlling drugs.



Although the drug issue has persisted throughout U.S. political history
since Congress moved in 1887 to restrict the importation of opium into
the United States and later enacted the landmark Harrison Narcotics Act
to regulate professionals dealing with narcotic drugs in 1914, it was
conservative Republican President Ronald Reagan who elevated the issue
to the national spotlight with his War on Drugs of early the 1980s.
Since, the issue has remained of significant public and political
importance, with members of the Republican Party trying during elections
to outdo one another with antidrug promises and elected officials of the
party quarreling over the best way to interdict drugs and squelch abuse.


In the 1980s, President Reagan expanded the federal government\'s drug
interdiction effort while Nancy Reagan, the first lady, led a \"Just Say
No\" campaign against drugs that equated use with immorality. During the
Reagan administration, Congress passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986,
which greatly expanded the war against on trafficking and abuse. A
three-way division soon emerged among prominent Republicans in the
Reagan administration over how to carry out the drug war. Attorney
General Edwin Meese advocated getting tough with drug users. He said
drug testing should be required of all workers, arguing that it reduces
accidents and boosts productivity while keeping people from disobeying
the law. Another faction, led by Otis Bowen, Reagan\'s secretary of
health and human services, stressed education and rehabilitation, an
approach often taken by Democrats. William J. Bennett, a conservative
who served as Reagan\'s Secretary of Education, argued for greater
military involvement in stemming the influx of drugs. He also urged
Reagan to appoint a drug czar, but the president opposed it on grounds
that it would necessitate more \"big government.\"










2 Republicans Lose the War on Drugs
=================================================================================


Despite the Reagan administration\'s efforts to eradicate drugs, many
political analysts saw the issue as a political defeat for Reagan,
largely because the war against drugs had not been won. And many thought
it could not be won.



But that view did not stop Republican President George Bush from
continuing Reagan\'s antidrug efforts. After passage of the Anti-Drug
Abuse Act of 1988, which created a cabinet-level drug czar, Bush
appointed Bennett to the post after Republican Senator Dennis DeConcini
of Arizona turned it down. Bennett focused on combatting street sales of
drugs and on financing antidrug efforts in the countries from which the
drugs were originating.



Other Republicans have also played a significant role in fighting drug
use. In 1970, Republican President Richard Nixon helped encourage
passage of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse and Control Act, which
reinforced narcotics penalties. In the mid 1990s, Republicans, led by
conservative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Speaker of the House,
pressured the administration of Democratic President Bill Clinton to
rethink its emphasis on providing drug addicts with treatment while
limiting support for overseas antidrug campaigns. The Clinton approach,
Republicans argue, fails to effectively diminish the supply of illicit
drugs, thereby stimulating drug use.



Gingrich, in particular, has been among the most outspoken conservatives
against drug traffickers during the mid 1990s. He said that anyone
responsible for shipping drugs into the country should be put to death.



In view of such antidrug campaigns as those of Gingrich, Bennett, and
Reagan, it has been conservatives who have usually led the antidrug
charge among Republicans, but they have often been backed by their more
moderate colleagues.
