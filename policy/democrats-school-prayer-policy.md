1 Favoring the Constitution over Religion
====================================================


Members of the Democratic Party have been far less inclined to support
school prayer than their Republican brethren, with the majority of the
party strongly aligned against it. One faction within the Democratic
Party, however, has included some divergent members who favor an
amendment to allow prayer in public schools: Southern conservatives.



Yet it should be noted that on an issue as deeply personal as religion,
elected Democrats \-- including both those in Congress and in past
administrations \-- have often been impelled by personal reasons,
ideologies, or beliefs to either support or denounce school prayer.
Their positions have also been swayed by historical or legal arguments.



The issue, long at the margins of U.S. political history, took center
stage after the 1982 election of conservative Republican President
Ronald Reagan, who proposed an amendment to remove the legal barrier to
prayer in public schools, making him the first chief executive to turn
the country\'s attention to the issue. The Supreme Court banned prayer
from public schools in the 1960s.


After Reagan\'s proposal, some of the most intensive lobbying of the
1980s took place as right-wing Christian fundamentalists rallied behind
the amendment. But fierce opposition from Democrats and liberal,
Protestant, and Jewish organizations kept proponents from amassing the
required votes to secure passage.



Leading the school prayer charge for conservative Southern Democrats was
Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina. He argued that the court
rulings of the 1960s banning school prayer were a misinterpretation of
the Constitution, necessitating an amendment to neutralize what he and
other conservatives saw as a hostile government policy toward religion.
Yet for many Democrats, protecting the sanctity of the Constitution
outweighed any personal inclinations for favoring school prayer.



2 Opposition to Reagan\'s Proposal
====================================================

The majority of Senate Democrats forcefully opposed Reagan\'s proposal.
Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum of Ohio played a strong role for the
Democrats in criticizing the amendment. The Democrats maintained that it
would violate the country\'s tradition of separation between church and
state and that the Constitution should be amended only in the most
clear-cut cases and for the most pressing reasons. Senator Bill Bradley,
Democrat of New Jersey, summed up the opposition of many Democrats when
he stated that no prayer would ever be found acceptable for the array of
diverse religions represented in America\'s schools. Other Democrats
voiced fears that school prayer would be used as religious
indoctrination by a community\'s dominant majority. Besides, they said,
the amendment would be pragmatically impossible to implement such
legislation.



Conservative Republicans, the chief supporters of the amendment, cited
the omnipresence of God in the classroom and the right of students to
pray to Him. And they rebutted the Democrats and moderate Republicans by
maintaining that local communities could be entrusted to resolve the
problem of implementing the amendment and the possibility of
trivializing prayer. They contended that the federal government should
not place limits of expression on local communities.


Although Congress rejected the school prayer amendment, it passed the
Equal Access Act of 1984, which prohibits school districts from
discriminating against high school religious clubs. Religious-right
lobbyists and ultra-conservatives viewed the act as a partial victory.



In the mid 1990s, the Christian Coalition revived the issue of school
prayer, pushing a Religious Equality Amendment to the Constitution that
would allow expression of religion in such public forums as schools. The
amendment received the blessing of ultra-conservative Republican
Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Speaker of the House, and
his more moderate Republican colleague Robert Dole of Kansas, the Senate
Majority Leader and a 1996 presidential candidate. The Democratic
administration of President Bill Clinton and most Democratic Party
members opposed it.
