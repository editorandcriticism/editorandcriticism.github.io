1 Proposals
=================================


In 1938, Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt introduced the
minimum wage as part of his New Deal with the Fair Labor Standards Act.
Since then, Congress has significantly revised and expanded its terms,
relying on not only general bipartisan backing but also loyal support
from elected members of the Democratic Party.







Despite frequent bipartisan backing, Democrats have found themselves
fighting for increases in the minimum wage over objections from
conservative Republicans, free market libertarians, and business groups,
who argue that a higher wage will raise unemployment and inflate prices,
actually hurting the people that proponents say would be helped.
Opponents of increasing the minimum wage also say it would drive up all
wages. Many conservative Republican members of Congress favor a policy
of letting the free market establish wages, and some maintain there
should be no minimum wage at all.



Most Democrats reject this reasoning. They maintain that raising the
minimum wage does not result in higher unemployment or inflation.
Neither does it push up all wages, they say. In fact, the Democrats
point out, a recent increase in California\'s minimum wage actually led
to less unemployment. Democrats also argue that every worker has the
right to earn a subsistence wage. President Bill Clinton has led the
Democrats\' drive during the mid 1990s to raise the minimum wage. He
proposed that it be raised by 90 cents over 2 years, from its current
\$4.25 an hour to \$5.15 an hour.



2 Proponents and Opponents
===============================================================


Principal Democratic sponsors of minimum wage legislation in Congress
have included Senator Edward M. Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat who is
on the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, and Representative
Augustus Hawkins, a California Democrat on the House Committee on
Education and Labor. Senator Kennedy, in particular, has long fought to
increase the minimum wage. He and his fellow Democrats argue that
inflation has undermined the purchasing power of the minimum wage and
that many entry-level workers will be condemned to a
less-than-subsistence wage unless the minimum is expanded.



Kennedy and Hawkins\' chief opponents in the battle over raising the
minimum wage have been Senator Orrin Hatch, a conservative Republican
from Utah who sits on the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, and
Representative Steve Bartlett, a Texas Republican on the House Committee
on Education and Labor.



Representative Martin Olav Sabo of Minnesota, the ranking Democrat on
the House Budget Committee, has taken President Clinton\'s proposal even
further. He introduced a measure that would not only raise the rate by
more than the President\'s proposal, but also limit the tax
deductibility of executive compensation at 25 times that of the
company\'s lowest-paid employee.
