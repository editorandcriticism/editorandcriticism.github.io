1 Conservative-Moderate Fracture
====================================================



In 1968, the official platform of the Republican Party said it planned
to take a \"flexible approach to minimum wage laws.\" That statement has
characterized much of the party\'s position since Congress passed the
Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938, establishing a minimum wage. Since
then, Congress has significantly revised and broadened its terms.



But even though minimum wage proposals have often drawn bipartisan
support, members of the Republican Party have at times found themselves
at odds on the issue. The most common fracture has been along
conservative-moderate lines. Many conservatives favor a policy of
letting the free market establish wages, and some maintain there should
be no minimum wage at all. Senator Orrin Hatch, a conservative
Republican from Utah and the senior Republican on the Committee on Labor
and Human Resources, and Representative Steve Bartlett, a Texas
Republican on the House Committee on Education and Labor, have fought
against recent attempts to raise the minimum wage, arguing that a higher
wage will increase unemployment and inflate prices, actually hurting the
people that proponents say would be helped.



House Majority Leader Richard Armey, Republican of Texas, vowed to fight
Democratic President Bill Clinton\'s proposed increase in the minimum
wage with \"every fiber\" of his body. Moderate Republicans, on the
other hand, have not been so adamant. Although some of them reject an
increase in the minimum wage as unnecessary, others have tended to argue
that workers in entry-level positions deserve pay adequate enough to
live on and that raising the minimum wage does not necessarily increase
unemployment or inflation. Additional debate among party members has
focused not on so much on whether there should be a minimum wage, but
what it should be.



Throughout his eight years in the White House, Conservative Republican
President Ronald Reagan was content to keep the minimum wage the same,
but that did not stop Republican George Bush, Reagan\'s vice president,
from pledging to raise the wage during his 1988 campaign for president.
The most controversial part of Bush\'s plan turned out to be the
so-called training wage, a condition of his campaign pledge. The
proposal drew opposition from Democrats.



2 Alternative Methods of Helping
====================================================


Other Republicans have sought to address the
minimum issue by proposing alternative methods of helping the working
poor. For example, Representative Thomas Petri, a Republican from
Wisconsin, has introduced legislation to expand the earned-income tax
credit, the subsidy paid to low-income working parents. However,
Petri\'s proposal, which pegs the tax credit to the number of children
in a family, also drove a wedge into party unity. Ultra-conservative
Republicans condemn it as social engineering.


Before becoming Bush\'s Republican vice president, Dan Quayle of
Indiana, at the time senior Republican on the Senate\'s subcommittee on
labor, supported an increase in the earned-income tax credit along with
a gradual increase in the minimum wage.
