1 Conservative-Moderate Split
=====================================================================


Although members of the Republican Party as a whole have been more
inclined to support a school prayer amendment than their Democratic
brethren, the party has by no means stood unified on the issue.



School prayer has split Republicans in Congress largely along
conservative-moderate lines, but that is not to say all conservatives
support it while all moderates do not. On an issue as deeply personal as
religion, elected Republicans \-- including both those in Congress and
in past administrations \-- have often been impelled by personal
reasons, ideologies, or beliefs to either support or denounce freedom of
prayer in public schools. Their positions have also been swayed by
historical or legal arguments.


The issue, long at the margins of U.S. political history, took center
stage after the 1982 election of conservative Republican President
Ronald Reagan, who proposed an amendment to remove the legal barrier to
prayer in public schools, making him the first chief executive to turn
the country\'s attention to the issue. The Supreme Court banned prayer
from public schools in the 1960s. After Reagan\'s proposal, some of the
most intensive lobbying of the 1980s took place as right-wing Christian
fundamentalists rallied behind the amendment. But fierce opposition from
liberal, Protestant, and Jewish organizations kept proponents from
amassing the required votes to secure passage.



Reagan\'s proposal quickly divided elected the Republican Party as the
Senate debated the president\'s proposal in 1984. Ultra-conservative
Republican Senators Jesse Helms of North Carolina, a long-time supporter
of school prayer, and Orrin G. Hatch of Utah played forceful roles in
the drive to pass the legislation. They were backed by such other
conservatives as Alan Simpson of Wyoming and William V. Roth of
Delaware.



Among the conservatives who opposed the school prayer plan was Arlen
Specter of Pennsylvania. Many moderate Republicans fought against
Reagan\'s amendment. Both of Oregon\'s moderate Senators, Bob Packwood
and Mark O. Hatfield, argued against it, as did John C. Danforth of
Missouri and William S. Cohen of Maine. Lowell P. Weicker, a
moderate-to-liberal Republican who later served as the Independent
governor of Connecticut, strongly contested the amendment throughout the
debate. Slade Gorton of Washington also resisted it.



2 Amendment Would Violate Separation of Church and State
====================================================

These moderate conservatives argued that the amendment would render
prayer insignificant by diluting it to serve the diverse religions
represented in America\'s schools or would be used as religious
indoctrination by the dominant majority. Some also maintained that it
would violate the country\'s tradition of separation between church and
state. Besides, they said, it would be pragmatically impossible to
implement such legislation.


The conservatives cited the omnipresence of God in the classroom and the
right of students to pray to Him. And they rebutted the moderates by
maintaining that local communities could be entrusted to resolve the
problem of implementing the amendment and the possibility of
trivializing prayer. They contended that the federal government should
not place limits of expression on local communities.



Although Congress rejected the school prayer amendment, it passed the
Equal Access Act of 1984, which prohibits school districts from
discriminating against high school religious clubs. Religious-right
lobbyists and ultra-conservative Republicans viewed the act as a partial
victory.



In the mid 1990s, the Christian Coalition revived the issue of school
prayer, pushing a Religious Equality Amendment to the Constitution that
would allow expression of religion in such public forums as schools. The
amendment has received the blessing of ultra-conservative Representative
Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Speaker of the House, and his more
moderate Republican colleague Robert Dole of Kansas, the Senate Majority
Leader and a 1996 presidential candidate.
