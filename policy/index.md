### Essays in Political Philosophy


<i class="fa fa-file-text-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> [Image over Substance: An Example of Postmodern
Politics](/md/cult1.html): Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno, commenting on Hitler\'s
propagandistic use of the radio, note \"the gigantic fact that the
speech that penetrates everywhere replaces its content,\"1 a formula
that has been taken one step further by television: On TV, the image
dominates, overpowering not only the fact of speech but also its content.

<i class="fa fa-file-text-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> [The Relation Between Civic Society and
Newspapers in the Writings of Alexis de Tocqueville and Robert
Putnam](/md/putnam1.html): The purpose of this essay is to demonstrate how Robert
Putnam\'s findings in Making Democracy Work and in a later study he
published on civic participation in the United States, \"The Strange
Disappearance of Civic America,\" support Tocqueville\'s views. This
will be accomplished in two steps. The first will examine whether the
specific views of Tocqueville regarding associations and newspapers and
the relations between them are borne out in Putnam\'s findings. The
second step will examine how Putnam\'s findings support Tocqueville\'s
central hypothesis: That equality is the fundamental condition in a
democracy from which others are derived. A final section of the essay
will specify several normative implications that may be drawn from
Putnam\'s findings, especially those outlined in \"The Strange
Disappearance of Civic America.\"


<i class="fa fa-file-text-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> [Habermas\' Theory of Discourse
Ethics](/philosophy/habermas-ethics.html): The purpose of this essay is to reveal the central distinctive
elements of JÃ¼rgen Habermas\' theory of discourse ethics and how his
moral theory differs from those of two other prominent philosophers,
Immanuel Kant and John Rawls. In unveiling the distinctive qualities of
Habermas\' discourse ethics, the fundamental difference between it and
Kant\'s moral theory, upon which Habermas in part bases his thought,
will be explained. Next, in exposing another distinctive element of
discourse ethics, a pivotal difference between Habermas\' moral theory
and John Rawls\' theory of justice will be elucidated.

<i class="fa fa-file-text-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> [Durkheim on Educational
Systems](/philosophy/durkheim-on-education.html): In Emile Durkheim\'s view, educational systems reflect
underlying changes in society because the systems are a construct built
by society, which naturally seeks to reproduce its collectively held
values, beliefs, norms, and conditions through its institutions. Thus,
as time unfolds, educational systems come to contain the imprint of past
stages in the development of society, as each epoch leaves its imprint
on the system. By uncovering these imprints and analyzing them, the
development of a society can be reconstructed from the educational
system.
